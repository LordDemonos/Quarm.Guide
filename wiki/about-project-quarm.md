# Main Ruleset

- Time-Locked Progression Server - 9 Months of Classic, 9 Months of Kunark, 9 Months of Velious, 9 Months of Luclin, Planes of Power final expansion.
- Planes of Power may contain custom mechanics post-PoP, such as rotating hotzones.
- One-Box Policy, enforced by IP & manual CSR intervention. [#petitions](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1153470935421157396)
- Era restrictions apply to prevent out-of-era mechanics. This is done selectively.
- MGBs at level 1, and other 'TAKP-like' features are enabled selectively. For example, Monk AC is in its 'pre-nerf' state.
- Selective Clientside Quality of Life - Mouse Wheel Camera, Buff Timers, Auto-Stand on Cast. Additional QOL have been added through [Zeal](#step-4-installing-zeal).

## Optional Self Imposed Rulesets

These three rulesets may be toggled on independently or all at once at Level 1 at any Priest of Discord. 
The process of doing so resets your character and all of its data to as if it had just spawned in the game world, and prevents future ruleset toggling.

### Self Found
This is a gametype that restricts interactions with standard ruleset players. This is more akin to a "Group Self Found / Group Ironman" ruleset if enabled by itself.
The following restrictions are imposed:
- You cannot group or raid with players who are not also playing the Self Found ruleset.
- You cannot be buffed or healed by other players who are outside of your experience credit range.
- You cannot trade with other players.
- You cannot purchase items from merchants that aren't already on the merchant.
- You cannot loot items that were handed to an NPC by a player off of the NPC's corpse.
- You cannot sell or buy items in The Bazaar.
- You cannot pick up dropped items on the ground that are dropped by other players. Standard ground spawns do not apply to this rule.
- You cannot loot items from 'opened' corpses. You must receive initial experience credit per the ruleset to loot the item(s) you wish to loot.
- You cannot loot items from corpses of mobs you weren't in a group or raid experience credit range of.
- You must engage a creature at 100% HP to receive experience or loot for yourself, your group or your raid, and deal at least 50% of the mob's health in damage to receive experience.
- *NOTE: Normal damage rules additionally apply to the target for experience credit. The NPC regenerating to 100% HP will reset this flag.*

### Solo Only
This is a gametype that restricts interactions with all other players, including other ruleset players. The restrictions here override the restrictions in Self Found if they would conflict. This is akin to a "Solo Self Found / Ironman" ruleset found in other games.
The following restrictions are imposed:
- You cannot group or raid with other players.
- You cannot be buffed or healed by other players.
- You cannot trade with other players.
- You cannot purchase items from merchants that aren't already on the merchant.
- You cannot loot items that were handed to an NPC by a player off of the NPC's corpse.
- You cannot sell or buy items from The Bazaar.
- You cannot pick up dropped items on the ground that are dropped by other players. Standard ground spawns do not apply to this rule.
- You must engage a creature at 100% HP to receive experience or loot for yourself and deal at least 50% of the mob's health in damage to receive experience. Normal damage rules additionally apply to the target for experience credit. The NPC regenerating to 100% HP will reset this flag.
- You cannot loot items from 'opened' corpses. You must receive initial credit per the ruleset to loot the item(s) you wish to loot.

### Hardcore
This is a gametype that will result in permanent deletion of your character upon your first death above the item loss level. This is also known as a "Permadeath" ruleset found in other games.
There are no restrictions like the rulesets above have, but this may be toggled on in addition to the above two rulesets.
- *NOTE: Characters who have hit a milestone under the hardcore ruleset that die will be broadcast to the entire server. Their corpse will instantly decay and the character will be reset.
There will be no character recovery after a death.*

## Gameplay Changes

- No 'Out of Group Range' exploit - a player who is physically out of range of other players may not receive an experience bonus as if they were in a group.
- Tradeskill containers will delete nodrop items for everyone, including the player who placed it there.

The following zones have 'pull limits' and when you aggro a quantity of mobs over these numbers, they will instantly teleport on you instead of chase you:

- hohonora    Halls of Honor    15
- pofire    Plane of Fire    15
- povalor    Plane of Valor    20
- solrotower    Tower of Solusek Ro    20
- podisease    Plane of Disease    25
- poeartha    Plane of Earth    25
- poearthb    Plane of Earth    25
- ponightmare    Plane of Nightmares    25
- postorms    Plane of Storms    25
- potactics    Drunder, the Fortress of Zek    25
- vexthal    Vex Thal    28
- skyfire    Skyfire Mountains    30
- poinnovation    Plane of Innovation    40
- pojustice    Plane of Justice    40
- potorment    Torment, the Plane of Pain    40

### Reduced Respawn Timers & Anti Kite 

For launch, we will impose a limit on the amount of mobs that can be pulled in newbie zones to 4. Anti Kite code will be applied after 4 NPCs are pulled. This is to prevent folks from monopolizing zones with PBAOE classes early on.

Newbie zones will also have a reduced respawn rate on all NPCs. NPCs between 12 and 60 second respawns will be reduced to 12 seconds. NPCs between 61 seconds and 499 seconds will be reduced to 60 seconds.

Newbie zones are normally major cities with newbie yards, and adjacent stomping grounds such as South Ro, East Commonlands or Qeynos Hills.

This restriction will be removed after zones thin out or 7 days, whichever comes sooner.

## Legacy Items

There are no longer permanent loot lockouts from legacy items. However, there will be an individual character-based loot lockout on all legacy items that are obtained through looting. The lockout is a month long.
- *NOTE: This is so that if you lose a legacy item due to an untimely death and you lose your corpse, you are able to loot another one in a way that doesn't involve a CSR.*
- *NOTE2: All existing lockouts have been converted to loot lockout legacy items, lasting 30 days from the release of 1.3 content.*

There are a number of revamps to Time-Limited Legacy Items. These new versions will be functionally identical, require specific levels to acquire, and will all be no drop. The Time-limited factor will only apply to legacy items that are able to be traded, and are traditionally time-limited, nerfed, or removed in EQ's timeline that we select to be. They are, currently, as follows:
- Manastone -> Manarock (30) (Functionally Identical)
- Rubicite Armor -> Pinkicite Armor (25, 30) (It's Pink, Functionally Identical)
- Thex Dagger -> Thexian Shiv (0) (Faction Requirement)
- Scimitar of the Mistwalker -> Falchion of the Mistwalker (30) (Functionally Identical)
- Lustrous Russet Armor -> Brilliant Russet Armor (46) (It's Teal, Functionally Identical)**
- *NOTE:* **The above will be available indefinitely, even after an item's removal.*

The following items will stay in the game indefinitely.
- Ring of the Dead (We may opt to make zones unable to be bound in, however.)
- Guise of the Deceiver (30) (We feel that it's unfair to make this go away for those who haven't obtained one, and it is otherwise no trade. Its level requirement stays, however)
- Journeyman's Boots (20) (We feel as though the contested nature of the creatures that would award jboots through the quest are not worth the headache for players, and our legacy item system better suits the milestone for players.)

Items that are deemed too powerful but are otherwise consumable (like Dragon Teeth) will see these items no longer drop at all.

The following items are not traditionally legacy items in EverQuest, but have seen a legacy flag added to ease camp congestion. They will not be removed at all at any point during the timeline, nor will spawns be eased:
- Bag of Sewn Evil Eye (30) (Staying indefinitely)
- Fishbone Earring (20) (Staying indefinitely)
- Glowing Black Stone (15) (Staying indefinitely)
- Robe of the Oracle (25) (Staying Indefinitely - Changes to Standard in Kunark)

## Kunark Legacy Items and Respawn Rates

- Lord Begurgle's Crown will now drop off of any aqua goblin at the same rate as Lord Begurgle.
- Sebilis Crypt named are now 100% chance to spawn and the placeholders' loot (Scroll of the Dark) has been moved to the main bosses.
- Hierophant's Cloak will now drop at 0.2% of the time off of any krup froglok, similar to the Runebranded Girdle.
- The Fungus Covered Scale Tunic and Fungus Covered Great Staff from the Myconid Spore King in Sebilis are now legacy items and no-drop. The drop rates of all 3 items have been boosted for those two legacy items. The minimum required level to loot these two items is set to 50.
- Myconid Creatures (excluding the spore king) now drop a tradable copy of the Fungus Covered Great Staff and Fungus Covered Scale Tunic (Fungus Covered Great Stick, Fungus Covered Scale Shirt)
- Circlet of Shadows is now permanently the pre-nerf Circlet of Shadow. Any named creature in Droga can now drop the tradable Circlet of Shadow at 100% chance with a legacy loot restriction of Level 35 and a 30-day lockout timer.
- Reduced the spawn timer of 'an angry goblin' from 3 days with variance to 15 minutes.

- Various Kunark dungeons have been flagged as reduced respawn dungeons.

- a sarnak courier and its spawngroup is now set to 17s, with a 6% chance of spawn. The chance to loot the Goblin Gazughi Ring is now 2%. The Goblin Gazughi Ring is now a legacy item that is lootable at level 15, and the lockout time is 30 days. The intent of this is to make the Goblin Gazughi Ring camp similar to Quillmane. (edited)
- Lord Gimblox now spawns more frequently over other NPCs in his spawngroup. The timer for Gimblox to spawn has been reduced to 15 minutes.
- Eldreth in Lake Rathetear now respawns after 15 minutes.
- Shmendrik Lavawalker in Lake Rathetear now respawns after 15 minutes.
- Astral Projection in Lake Of Ill Omen and Overthere is now a 15 minute respawn timer, and is now charm immune.
- Founy Jestands now spawns with the parchment 100% of the time, and 4 of them can drop.
- Tani N'Mar now spawns with the parchment 100% of the time, and 4 of them can drop.
- a seeker in Solusek Temple is now a 15 minute respawn timer.
- Naxot Deepwater in Burning Wood is now a 15 minute respawn timer.
- The General's Dark Elves in Kithicor are now 15 minute spawns. Legacy loot applies to all special items from the Dark Elves - 46 to loot, 30 day lockout. This does not affect the turnin for the General.
- Yendar Starpyre is now a 15 minute respawn. The Shining Metallic Robe from Yendar is now subject to legacy loot (level 46, 30 day lockout)
- Shmendrik Lavawalker is now a 15 minute spawn.
- Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt is now a 30 second respawn timer.
- Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt is now a 30 second respawn timer.
- a mountain giant patriarch now spawns more frequently.
- Gated all of the Chardok 2.0 items from dropping in Chardok. This is a stopgap until the zone can be un-revamped.
- an iksar betrayed in Chardok now spawns much more frequently.
- a drolvarg pawbuster and a drolvarg warlord will now share the same spots with the bodyguards (4 spawns total) and all now have 15 minute respawns. Warlord will drop the Petrified Werewolf Skull 100% of the time. - Both the Metal Pipe and Petrified Werewolf Skull are now subject to legacy loot (level 46, 30 day lockout) to prevent griefing and farming.
- Brother Balatin now spawns 100% of the time.
- a fire sprite is now a 2 minute respawn timer.
- a sleeping ogre is now a 5 minute respawn timer.
- Kaiaren is now a 5 minute respawn timer, and is now charm immune.
- Eldrig the Old now spawns separately at 100% chance on his own spawn group every 15 minutes.
- Nezekezena now spawns separately at 100% chance on his own spawn group every 15 minutes.

## Private Guild Instances and Quakes

Due to overwhelming player feedback about casual accessibility, and my own intuition on the subject, we've overhauled how raid rotations work - by scrapping them and replacing them with private guild instances. Don't worry, competition is still available via an overhauled Earthquake system!

- Guild instances are accessible via the Knowledge book near any adjacent-to-raid zone where the tryout books were formerly present.
- Guild instances require an officer from your guild, 12 guild members, and 18 players total in a raid to enter, as well as the requirement of all members in your raid being over level 30.
- Guild instances have a combat engagement requirement equal to the above. If you do not meet the engage requirement above, players are forced to their bind point on any combat action, including friendly heals.
- Guild instances have heightened respawn when compared to normal instances. This means that every raid creature may not share the same timer as open-world creatures.
- If your corpse becomes unretrievable in a guild instance, fear not: The Graveyard system from Planes of Power is active in these zones, and your corpses will be dispensed every 2 hours to the adjacent zone where the zone-in book is located.

Guild instances do not award loot for any other creature than the raid target(s) in question. For the current instances, this is the following:
- Nagafen's Lair (Instanced)
- Lord Nagafen - 7 Days
- Giants (all) - 24 Hours

- Permafrost Caverns (Instanced)
- Lady Vox - 7 Days

- Kedge Keep (Instanced)
- Phinigel - 24 Hours

Please note that if not otherwise specified, creatures in instances have 24 hour respawn rates, and give significantly reduced experience. (virtually nothing) Guild creation has been disabled via petitions until a lockout system has been created for the Guild Instances.

- EarthQuake revamp
- Earthquakes are now scheduled to occur every 3 to 7 days.
- Earthquakes now have a duration of three (3) hours.
- Earthquakes no longer have a ruleset. Server Rules 9.x and 10.x are suspended during earthquakes for raid zones. Please assume that if your zone doesn't give a message about NPCs being re-popped, that you still have to adhere to rules 9.x and 10.x still.

The current zones considered to be raid zones are:
- Permafrost Caverns
- Nagafen's Lair
- Kedge Keep

On an earthquake triggering, everyone in the zone is evacuated to the zone-in to ensure fair competition. If you wish to avoid the evac, position yourself outside of the zone. Earthquake timers are now visible to guild leaders and officers ahead of their trigger time. No more batphones. Typing '#showquake' will allow a guild officer or leader to view the next earthquake time. Earthquakes no longer have guild engage requirements due to the rule 9.x and 10.x suspension during the three hour period, and thus can be pickup grouped.

## Planes

### The Plane of Fear, The Plane of Sky, and The Plane of Hate are all open! 

Please note that the following changes were made to the zones for Project Quarm:

- All boss creatures will not appear in the Open World until an Earthquake.
- Instanced trash will drop loot and will not lock players out, but will have heightened respawn timers.
- Open world trash will retain its normal respawn timers.
- Quests are enabled in all open world / instanced versions of Sky, Hate and Fear.
- Almost every Epic piece, outside of some select Sky pieces, will not drop in the Plane of Sky, Fear, or Hate.

### Fear:

- Slime Blood of Cazic Thule will drop in place of Skin of Cazic for all eras, however this item will be locked to Kunark.
- The Golems in Fear are their 51/52 selves - they will not drop any loot until Kunark. This is normal, as they only would drop epic pieces. They do not death touch, which is era-accurate. Do not report this with a bug.
- Cazic-Thule is his level 55 self. He has fairly low resistance for his level, however, he now has his Velious-era crowd control immunities.
a dracoliche is its level 53 self, with Rotting Flesh & Dragon Roar. a dracoliche does not gain its lifetap until the Velious-era revamp.
- Class armor and Lustrous Russet drop indefinitely.
- Irak & Wraith of a Shissar are Kunark gated.

### Hate:

- Mini-bosses are not present until Velious.
- Innoruuk does not have his revamped loot table. Most of the loot that would drop off of minis have been moved to Innoruuk per classic timeline.
- Maestro of Rancor has his classic-era loot table. Yes, this includes the Basoon Haste Gauntlets, which are not considered a Legacy Item for the sake of this timeline.
- Hand of the Maestro spawns separate to the Maestro of Rancor from the get-go, however the hand item is Kunark gated.
- Class armor is available from the beginning from all trash.
- Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth is available even in classic. However, Staff of Elemental Mastery: Fire will not drop until Velious.
- Most Kunark Epic Quest loot are otherwise unavailable until Kunark.
- The Book of Souls is not up. For real, I'm not lying, I didn't pick up the book. It will return in Kunark.

### Sky:

- Open World: All boss creatures will be spawned upon an Earthquake occurring without any scripted encounters needing to be completed
- Keys are no longer no rent, and will be added to the keyring.
- Instance: You must complete the instance by progressing through it normally.
- Instance: Keeper of Souls now spawns instantly on the death of a soul tamer without a waiting period. However, it is not possible to trigger multiple Keeper of Souls within the same 18 hour period.
- You may only interact with the Key Master in Open World for the purpose of interacting with him as a merchant.
- A huge thanks to Torven of EQEmulator for parsing a ton of information related to combat and flavor text ahead of launch in the Plane of Sky and giving it the proper TLC it deserves. Thanks to you, the information contained in the Plane of Sky will be preserved indefinitely

### Welcome to the Ruins of Old Paineel, also known as The Hole! 

This zone is being released ahead of Kunark, which is a major departure from EQ's original timeline. It's our team's personal opinion that the items contained within The Hole aren't significantly powerful, and that releasing The Hole early is quite a treat for folks who are historically used to having to play it in Kunark.

- Most Epic NPCs will be disabled in The Hole ahead of Kunark. Please expect any Epic items that have snuck past our grasp to disappear at some point before Kunark.
- Master Yael is considered a raid target, as is Nortlav the Scalekeeper. Nortlav will spawn in Kunark.
- The Hole (Instanced) has appeared, and the book location will be in its normal location for those familiar with official EQ's Time-Locked Progression servers.
- The Hole (Instanced) is subject to other instanced zone experience penalties.
- The respawn time on The Hole (Instanced) is 18 hours across the board, except for Nortlav the Scalekeeper and Master Yael, who are 2d 18h respawns and are subject to loot lockout for the same duration. Loot can drop in The Hole.
- Most Kunark epic NPCs will be reduced to 15 minute respawn time in The Hole, or spawn more frequently in some way, shape or form.
- Rock golems are notably absent until Kunark.
- The Imbued Granite Spaulders are restricted to Kunark for drops due to their power within the era; however, Druzzil may have moved them to another, alternate timeline until Kunark...
- The undead still wander the caverns of the Ruins of Old Paineel at their original strength. Beware!

![hate](./assets/images/about/hate.jpg)

- Plane of Sky - East Freeport, ascending to the heavens behind where the Seafarer's Roost meets the East Freeport gates. Bring levitate!
- Graveyard: Just outside the gates in East Freeport.

## Mule Accounts

[Creating a mule](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1135968760281432164/1208195978016854096) The #makemule command is now available in game. Running the command in game will give you further instructions for how to flag the account as a mule and will ask that you run an additional command for confirmation.

Flagging an account as a mule can not be undone and will delevel the character running the command to 1 SO BE CERTAIN OF YOUR INTENTIONS. 

The character running the command must first be of appropriate level and no other characters can exist on the account when the command is run. Once an account is flagged as a mule then all characters on the account will be mules bound in EC tunnel and can not leave EC nor level past level 1. These accounts should not contribute to overall server population - this is so we can accurately track server population across third-party population tracking websites, such as UnixGeek's EQEmulator player stats.

The mule account will be exempt from IP restrictions allowing you to run a game client and buy/sell/transfer items independent of your main account. Again, RUNNING THE COMMAND AND CONFIRMING WILL DELEVEL YOU TO 1 AND FLAG THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT AS A MULE ACCOUNT. BE CERTAIN OF YOUR INTENTIONS. @CSR WILL NOT REVOKE THIS FLAG UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, NOR ARE THEY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH ANY ISSUES THAT ARISE.

## Elective Services Fees

The following is the current fees for elective character and account services. These services will only be handled under admin discretion. Limit 1 elective service per week.

- Character Surname Change: 500pp
- Character Gender Change: 500pp
- Guild Roster (Leaders and officers only): 500pp

## Events

#### Halloween Event (Shard of Decay) — 10/23/2023

![shard-of-decay](./assets/images/about/shard_of_decay.png)

Lorisyn Oakwynd has ventured out to various haunting grounds to investigate a Lycanthropic plague brought on by Plaguebringer acolytes. 

Strangely, they are not only chanting the God of Disease's name - they were observed joyously celebrating the God of Magic, Druzzil Ro.

Their hallowed worship has begun to corrupt the very ground around them - various Lycanthropes have appeared throughout the world.

Speak to Lorisyn Oakwynd in one of the following places to begin your investigation: 

- Qeynos Hills
- East Commonlands
- Everfrost
- Steamfont
- Greater Faydark
- Butcherblock
- Innothule
- Misty Thicket
- Feerrott
- Toxxulia

Extra Planar Disturbances have also been sighted. Tempted by the gift of Knowledge by Druzzil, Bertoxxulous followers have entered these planes - twisting themselves and their belongings into monstrous beings.

Rumored, too, that the plaguebringer Himself has projected His image in approval as a constant source of Lycanthropic blood.

The Shard of Decay is temporarily available for the next 2 weeks. This is a dungeon filled to the brim with undead.

The location is partially unknown. Seek the Karanas where werewolves gather, the Sands of Ro where undead gather, the cursed swamp of Innothule, the filthy excavation site of Paineel, and the Faydark where the Shadows dwell for potential anomaly sightings.

This is a zone aimed at level 8 to 25 adventurers, and has various sectors dedicated to those ranges. 

Trivial loot code is in effect, and you cannot loot green con NPC corpses in the zone. However, you can obtain faction by tagging them at least once.

Named creatures may appear during your crawl through the dungeon. These creatures share loot with the main boss, and any loot exclusive to them is considered legacy loot. This will not affect your ability to loot those items outside of the event, and those flags will be cleared following the event.

We recommend being at least level 13 to truly begin your expedition.

Lastly, the event reward requires a significant amount of faction to obtain. You need at least 1900 faction, and each blood will grant 50 faction. Each NPC faction hit will grant 1 faction.

We strongly encourage those who wish to help the lower players to do so, but CSRs will act against higher level players actively monopolizing the zone. Keep your interactions to taunts, buffs, and heals to snag crucial faction hits. Druzzil will be watching.

There are no level restrictions on the event outside of the zone. So, please feel free to participate in those events if you're max level to get the same blood that will also drop in the Shard of Decay.

Lastly, the main event reward will last up until the event ends. You may get another reward from Lorisyn at any time.

Lorisyn, all of the blood and anomalies will disappear at the same time.

### Brell's Blessed Land - 11/17/2023

During the period before Frostfell, the land needs to be prepared for celebration and merriment. 
The Shard of Decay has closed. Snow is falling on the ground in places where they shouldn't be, and the season of feasts is upon us.

However, Brell needs the land culled of various creatures that are capable of flight, and will reward adventurers kindly.

Druzzil and Brell have blessed the land for a limited period of time to aid with this effort, and Norrath shall reap the reward of experience.

Since we don't sell anything here, and you can't eat the server, we're giving the best feast of all:
Outdoor zones will receive a 0.20 increase to their ZEM for the duration of the event.
Any creatures capable of flight that are killed will grant a 0.50 increase to the bonus on top of ZEM for the duration of the event.
Snow will appear in place of rain as the land begins to get colder.

Flying creatures include the following:

`ghosts, gargoyles, specters, imps, harpies, pegasus, djinn, griffins, pixies, faeries, will-o-wisps, air elementals, wasps, bixies, drakes, reanimated hands, dragons, evil eyes, swordfish / fish / sharks (for meme factor) / phinigel (kedge descendents), whirling blades, bats, and aviaks`

### Domain of Frost AKA Halas — 12/19/2023

A mysterious Wizard from an extraplanar realm - who is rumored to be a Dragon - has thawed for her yearly awakening, and has conjured a portal to a hidden planar pocket to a fragmented memory - belonging to none other than E'Ci of the Triumvirate of Water. 
The strength of the Wizard rivals that of Veeshan's most trusted.

Upon opening the portal, a band of fire goblins, belonging to a Scrooge named Santaug Klaugg, have also infiltrated the pocket plane as it opened! They were spotted containing toys, trinkets, and were wearing various pieces of armor.

The Domain must be rescued! The Wizard has opened a portal to the pocket plane again; this time for adventurers to save the plane in the East Commonlands tunnel.

Due to her massive power and fear of being discovered as shady, the Shady Swashbuckler has taken up shop elsewhere in the tunnel, and has brought a banker friend with him. This banker friend is also extremely shady, though appears to be an honest fellow. 
He quite enjoys the company, and might be keeping his friend with him well after the Wizard's departure.

Enter the Domain of Frost, and reap the rewards within.
The Domain of Frost is a level 30 to 45 zone, being split right down the middle in terms of difficulty - the far side being much more difficult than the near side.
Trivial Loot Code is enabled in the Domain of Frost.
The Domain of Frost has a passive +0.05 experience boost within its walls.
There are rumors of a container of considerable storage within - if you manage to find one, it will require you to be of the 30th season to loot.
Bards who have lived to tell the tale also share a hidden compartment in the well - guilds may be interested in completing the trials within to get a time-limited reward. There are multiple ways to get this reward.
Know that this encounter is the most difficult of the raid encounters adventurers have faced thus far.

*NOTE: The reward item name contains a symbol - (t) - indicates that the item is temporary and will be removed following the event. Fret not about its power.*

Go forth, brave Norrathians - and conquer the icy depths of the Domain for E'Ci, and complete the tale of Fire and Ice! 

The graveyard for Domain of Frost now dispenses corpses in North Ro at the East Commonlands zoneline after 60 minutes.

### The Tower of Frost (AKA Oops, All Icebones) — 12/26/2023

The Tower of Frost is now available as a Level 8 to 25 undead zone featuring everyone's favorite friends: icebone skeletons. Big ones, small ones; some the size of your head.
This zone is exactly what you think it is. It's all icebone skeletons. There is no loot to be found here beyond bone chips, a few scraps of cloth and rusty weapons. Trivial loot code is enabled here, too, so don't think of coming in here if you're not at an appropriate level.

The basement is the most challenging, while the top level provides a medium level of difficulty. The entrance, of course, is the easiest part of the zone.

This zone has the same experience bonus that the Domain of Frost has, and this zone will be going away with the event's end on January 9th, 2024.

The graveyard on "Oops! All Icebones" now dispenses corpses in North Ro at the East Commonlands zoneline after 60 minutes instead of 1 minute.

### Erollisi Week - 02/13/2024

Erollisi Marr has temporarily broken free of the Plane of Love, and has sent Priests of Order to ordain Norrathians in marriage.
Couples from all across the land have gathered to partake in their own marriage ceremony. Seek out the Priest of Order in the East Commonlands Tunnel to begin the process!

To marry another player, first, you'll need to set up your family surname with the Priest of Order. 
The Priest of Order will then require the name of the person who is to take your hand in marriage. There are no level requirements on being married together.

They must be in the same zone as you, and upon their identical family name confirmation and vows of the name, you'll be married together... for the next week or two, at least, while Erollisi holds Her grasp over Norrath's mortal plane.

Marrying someone will provide a 20% experience bonus to all group experience while adventuring together with your partner. This bonus isn't stackable, and applies to the individual, similar to how race and class bonuses apply.

The bonus will be active for the duration of the event. When you are earning experience due to the bonus, you will receive a message in chat - "You receive a bonus! (Partner)"

To recap, the steps are as follows:
1) Set your temporary surname via the Priest of Order.
2) Say your partner's name to the Priest of Order.
3) Have your partner set their surname to your surname via the Priest of Order.
4) Have your partner say your name to the Priest of Order.
5) Congrats! You're married.

NOTE: You can say 'reset' to the Priest of Order, as long as you are not married yet, to reset your pending surname.

This will last for approximately 2 weeks from Valentine's Day, despite being the Erollisi Week event.
*Erollisi Day Surnames are subject to normal restrictions... except for the level requirements. These are not normal surnames; Erollisi has blessed all of us with the ability to set a temporary surname in the name of Love. After the event, these surnames disappear, as does your marriage.*

In addition to the Erollisi Day Event, please enjoy a 5% experience bonus separate to the event to all forms of experience that also stacks with the event bonus. This 5% bonus will run until the event's conclusion.

### Bristlebane Week - 04/01/2024

On April 1st, in celebration of Bristlebane Week, we will also be running a week-long-event. We may opt to extend it to two and probably will 'forget' to turn off the event. That seems to be a running joke lately.

We'll be turning on all the event zones again - Tower of Frost, Domain of Frost, and the Shard of Decay. Portals will once again be active in the East Commonlands Tunnel.

In addition to running those event zones, we will be turning on the Valentine's Day and Thanksgiving Weekend event - with a small twist.
As a refresher, here's the bonuses for that event's duration, with the updated week-long-event specifics!
Outdoor zones will give 4.20% experience bonus
Flying creatures will give a 6.9% experience bonus
You can get ceremonially married again in the East Commonlands Tunnel! Doing so will grant you a 20% bonus while being in a group with your partner and you will share this temporary surname for the duration of the event.

As a reminder, this is also April 1st. Please expect shenanigans in the game world for a limited time. If you manage to find the 'pranks', know they are temporary for the event, and will be removed after the event. But I intend to fully cause at least ONE (1) prank. Maybe several. Who knows.

### Bloodied Rivervale - 04/XX/2024

### King's Court Casino & Kerafyrm - Planes of Power Era [Source: Secrets](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1137470588366115049/1137471362315857950)

- The King's Court Casino will be integrated as Post-PoP content. (When Quarm is defeated)
- The Sleeper will reset every time he is awoken - until a custom, hidden event is activated in the Planes of Power.

I have something special planned related to the server name for the wakable sleeper. Certain events get set into motion by Kerafyrm's awakening, including the invasion of Norrath in Taelosia and the timeline split. If those events never happened - or rather, a demigod was able to keep tighter hold on certain events, we could see events never happen that should.

So yes, Kerafyrm may go on his rampage. But there's a certain force that will keep him imprisoned to keep this timeline alive in its state. 

There is a second way to end the tomb, but it won't be until the Planes are fully breached that the plan can be set into motion. Deicide has interesting connotations when it involves entities that shouldn't have that power.

## Server Downtime

Server Downtimes typically happen when the CSR team has available time. Announcements are posted in-game as well as [#server-status-downtime](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1160202360346378250). Server downtimes are typically concluded in about 5 minutes when everything goes according to plan.

TAKP Login Server downtimes typically happen every Wednesday and last for about 15 minutes. During this time you will be unable to log in and the server will appear offline. If you are already in game your service should not be affected. 

## IP Exemption

In order to make an IP exemption, make sure both accounts and characters have been created and have logged into the game at least once. You must then petition a CSR to perform the IP exemption here [#petitions](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1153470935421157396). Please include your character name and account name in the petition for faster service. This process can take a few days depending on the volume of petitions being made. 

## Rules

- Rule 0: Actively antagonizing the management will result in whatever cruel breed of nonsense they feel like at the time.
- Rule 1: If you have to ask if you can do it or not, just don't do it. This will likely resolve all of the below rules, but just in case, they're left here for your discretion.
- Rule 2: AFK Killing, Healing or otherwise causing progression is not allowed.
- Rule 2.1: All forms of automation software are not allowed and will be actioned the same as rule 3.
- Rule 2.2 Bards are exempt from this rule when pulsing a utility or party beneficial song. Pulsing refers to the mechanic of letting a song play automatically through use of in-game mechanics. Detrimental bard songs are not exempt from Rule 2. If the spell causes progression directly against a hostile creature on pulse, causes damage passively against another creature on pulse, or prevents progression of other players (such as Song of Highsun), the song is considered to be a violation of this rule. In the case of a new song type being abused, Customer Support Representatives may enforce this rule selectively on cases they feel to be an egregious violation of the spirit of Rule 2.2.
- Rule 2.3: Melody is not exempt from Rule 2.2.
- Rule 3: Any form of cheating - be it active hacks, or passive hacks - are not tolerated. Any software hooking, reading memory from, or otherwise interacting with the game client is also NOT TOLERATED. Macroquest, ShowEQ, Cheat Engine, Debuggers, EQBC, ect WILL GET YOU BANNED!
- Rule 3.1: We may selectively approve third-party programs that modify, read memory, or interact with the game. Those allowed will be listed in [#server-files](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1135981619858128998) .
- Rule 4: Multiboxing of any nature is not allowed for player characters.
- Rule 4.1: Multiboxing on accounts with IP exemptions will result in all accounts with that exemption getting banned without appeal.
- Rule 4.2: 'Mule' flagged accounts made with #makemule are not considered player characters and are exempt from Rule 4.0. However, you are limited to one mule per player. This is enforced by IP and CSR action will be taken as if it were a Rule 4.1 violation.
- Rule 5: We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to hate speech. For clarification, this includes any form of discrimination - such as racism, sexism, sexualization of minors, xenophobia, theophobia, homophobia, transphobia, etc. 
- Rule 5.1: Death threats and suggesting self-harm, suicide and/or homicide are not allowed.
- Rule 5.2: Sexually explicit content and/or discussion is not allowed.
- Rule 5.3: Discussing fetishes and/or posting fetish or fetish-adjacent images is not allowed. 
- Rule 5.4: Lying to, harassing and/or deceiving any staff or contributor is not allowed.
- Rule 5.5: If it breaks the Discord TOS, it's not allowed on our discord.
- Rule 5.6: Discussing politics or religion is not allowed.
- Rule 6: Report exploits via Private Message ONLY to Management. Abusing unreported exploits is not allowed.
- Rule 7: Ping any staff member at your own risk. If it's important enough that it's necessary, so be it. This includes DMs, we have day jobs so unless the server is on fire it probably doesn't need to be a DM.
- Rule 8: Account sharing will result in the loss of the accounts ability to file petitions and appeals to staff decisions.
- Rule 8.1: Any Suspension or Ban directed at a shared account will also be applied to all accounts of users who have accessed that account recently.
- Rule 8.2: Ban or suspension evasion is a bannable offense.
- Rule 9: Ninja looting is not allowed. Ninja looting is defined as taking an item from a corpse in violation of any pre-agreed upon loot arrangement while the corpse is locked. If there was no looting agreement ahead of time it does not qualify as ninja looting. Items taken while a corpse is unlocked is not ninja looting.
- Rule 9.1: Kill stealing will not be tolerated. Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.
- Rule 9.2: Player to player agreements outside the scope of rule 9 will not be enforced by staff.
- Rule 9.3: Intentional griefing and/or training is not allowed.
- Rule 10: Please respect raid and camp rules. Camp rules are listed in #⁠camp_rules. Raid rules are located in ⁠⁠[#raid-rules](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1136033679882326106).
- Rule 11: This space is intentionally left blank.
- Rule 12: Zone monopolization is not allowed. This is subjective to the Project Quarm staff as to what they deem zone monopolization, but generally it includes not reasonably sharing NPC spawns in zones, or mass pulling zones where other experience groups are participating in content. Bards included.
- Rule 13: RMT is not allowed. RMT is defined as any sort of arrangement that involves any form of in-game resource, asset, item, character, guild or anything otherwise represented in the database being exchanged for anything not represented in the database. Soliciting RMT is not allowed. Facilitating RMT is not allowed. Discussing RMT is not allowed. Proxy forms of RMT such as casinos, giveaways of donated items, and trading items for outside of game services are not allowed. Joking about RMT is not allowed.
- Rule 13.1: DKP systems are generally considered exempt from Rule 13 so long as the DKP can only be acquired via in game activities.
- Rule 13.2: Providing game-related services in exchange for anything not represented in the database falls under the scope of Rule 13.
- Rule 13.3: Providing non-game related services in exchange for anything represented in the database falls under the scope of Rule 13.
- Rule 14: We don't allow discussion of actions taken against rule violators. Please do not discuss action taken against any players, including yourself for violations of these rules. Any violation appeals MUST be handled through the ⁠petitions channel.

### Raid Rules

* Guild NPC Instances, with Earthquakes being the only way open-world spawns occur.

#### Private Guild Instances Are Available, Quakes Return!
- Due to overwhelming player feedback about casual accessibility, and my own intuition on the subject, we've overhauled how raid rotations work - by scrapping them and replacing them with private guild instances. Don't worry, competition is still available via an overhauled Earthquake system!
- Guild instances are accessible via the Knowledge book near any adjacent-to-raid zone where the tryout books were formerly present.
- Guild instances require an officer from your guild and 12 guild members to be at or above (30 in Classic, 50 in Kunark, 55 in Velious, 60 in Luclin, 65 in Planes of Power) in the guild you are attempting to create an instance for. This requirement is enforced by the server code and not our customer support staff.
- Guild instances have a combat engagement requirement equal to the above. If you do not meet the engage requirement above, players are forced to their bind point on any combat action, including friendly heals.
- Guild instances have heightened respawn when compared to normal instances. This means that every raid creature may not share the same timer as open-world creatures.
- If your corpse becomes unretrievable in a guild instance, fear not: The Graveyard system from Planes of Power is active in these zones, and your corpses will be dispensed every 2 hours to the adjacent zone where the zone-in book is located.
- Guild instances do not award loot for any other creature than the raid target(s) in question, unless otherwise specified. For the current instances, this is the following:
- 
**Nagafen's Lair (Instanced)**
- Lord Nagafen - 6d 18h
- Giants (all) - 18h

**Permafrost Caverns (Instanced)**
- Lady Vox - 6d 18h

**Kedge Keep (Instanced)**
- Phinigel - 18h

**Plane of Hate (Instanced)**
- Maestro of Rancor - 2d 18h
- Innoruuk - 6d 18h
- All Trash - 18h (No Lockout)

**Plane of Fear (Instanced)**
- a dracoliche - 2d 18h
- Cazic-Thule - 6d 18h
- All Trash, Quest NPCs - 18h (No Lockout)

**Plane of Sky (Instanced)**
- All Island Bosses - 18h
- All Trash, Quest NPCs - 18h (No Lockout)

Please note that if not otherwise specified, creatures in instances have 24 hour respawn rates, and give significantly reduced experience. (virtually nothing)
- Guild creation has been disabled via petitions until a lockout system has been created for the Guild Instances.

**EarthQuake revamp**
- Earthquakes are now scheduled to occur every 3 to 7 days.
- Earthquakes now have a duration of three (3) hours.
- Earthquakes no longer have a ruleset. Server Rules 9.x and 10.x are suspended during earthquakes for raid zones. Please assume that if your zone doesn't give a message about NPCs being re-popped, that you have to adhere to rules 9.x and 10.x still.
The current zones considered to be raid zones are:
**Permafrost Caverns**
**Nagafen's Lair**
**Kedge Keep**
**Plane of Sky**
**Plane of Fear**
**Plane of Hate**
- On an earthquake triggering, everyone in the zone is evacuated to the zone-in to ensure fair competition. If you wish to avoid the evac, position yourself outside of the zone.
- Earthquake timers are now visible to guild leaders and officers ahead of their trigger time. No more batphones. Typing '#showquake' will allow a guild officer or leader to view the next earthquake time.
- Earthquakes no longer have guild engage requirements due to the rule 9.x and 10.x suspension during the three hour period, and thus can be pickup grouped.

**Raid Rotations**
* Are dead. 🙂
