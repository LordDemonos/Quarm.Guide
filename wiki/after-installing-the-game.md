# After Installing the Main Game

## Understanding your EQClient.ini

The `eqclient.ini` file contains a list of settings that can be changed to suit your preferences, many of which cannot be changed in-game through the options window.

In Windows, the `eqclient.ini` is located within your EverQuest directory, wherever `eqgame.exe` resides.

Some commonly changed settings include:

- WindowedMode=TRUE/FALSE - This line must be typed out at the top but below [Defaults]. **Recommended set to FALSE**
- NewUI=TRUE/FALSE - Our client still has the old pre-Luclin UI for nostalgia mode. **Recommended set to TRUE**
- Log=TRUE/FALSE - Setting this true will automatically turn your log file on when entering the game. **Set to FALSE by default. Still seems to create chat logs though.**
- CombatMusic=TRUE/FALSE - Enable or disable melee combat music. **Recommended set to FALSE**
- ChannelAutoJoin=alliance - The Alliance channel is used as the global chat channel for the server.
- ChatKeepAlive=1 - Keeps the above chat channel from disconnecting by periodically sending communication to it.
- TargetGroupBuff=1 - This will allow you to buff groups with group buff spells from outside the group by targeting a member of the group. **Default set to 1**
- AttackOnAssist=FALSE - This will allow you to assist another player without automatically enabling auto attack. 
- MaxFPS= - This is the framerate you limit the foreground client window to. If this is set too high, it may consume too many system resources. Typically 60 is a good number to start with and adjust if necessary. A setting of 0 disables the limit.
- MaxBGFPS= - This is the framerate you limit the background client windows to. You don't want this too low, since it will affect autofollow ability. But, if you have it too high, it may consume too many system resources. 60 is typically good. A setting of 0 disables the limit.
- MouseRightHanded=1 - Switches mouse button orientation.
- MaxMouseLookFPS= - Allows you to set the mouselook FPS to help with mouselook slowness. If your mouselook is too slow, try adjusting this to 60 or 45. A setting of 0 disables the limit.
- AllLuclinPcModelsOff=TRUE - This disables Luclin models. This also allows use of the famous horse bug that existed on AK where you don't have the limitations of horse speed up/down that you do with Luclin models on.
- UISkin= - Sets your default UI skin. **I changed this value and it did nothing. Change in game.**
- [VideoMode]
- Width=1920
- Height=1080
- RefreshRate=60
- (match your display settings with the proper height and width prior to launching the game)`

- Velious armor textures:

- AllLuclinPcModelsOff=FALSE
- LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=TRUE
- LoadArmor17=TRUE
- LoadArmor18=TRUE
- LoadArmor19=TRUE
- LoadArmor20=TRUE
- LoadArmor21=TRUE
- LoadArmor22=TRUE
- LoadArmor23=TRUE

Velious armor textures are not enabled by default as they can cause an issue with Vah Shir armor not displaying. Most players would probably prefer them on however. [Source: wiki.takp](https://wiki.takp.info/index.php/Getting_Started_on_Windows)

There are some other flags that seem to be unique to Project Quarm [Source: #tech-help](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1133453502182596729/1177702642173087864). Some of these will only appear if you're using the latest .dll and only after logging into the game once. 

- [Options]
- MaxFPS=60 - These are similar to the ones above. Your goal is to set them as high as you can to match your display's refresh rate.
- MaxBGFPS=60
- MaxMouseLookFPS=60
- WindowedMode=TRUE
- MouseRightHanded=1
- NoFPSLimiter=0 - **This option will only work with the very latest experimental .dll and this is half the fix for the 3rd person stutters you previously experienced in older versions of Quarm. SET TO 0**

- EnableBrownSkeletonHack=FALSE - We had problems getting the correct skeleton models at first and some people like the brown ones. You can set this to TRUE or you can go find skeleton model replacements under Part 3. 
- EnableExtendedNameplateDistance=TRUE - Added after the 10/8/2023 .dll update that extended the nameplate distance.
- EnableClassicMusic=FALSE - Changes the music from old to new.

Zeal also has a number of `eqclient.ini` values that are saved here and this list will likely grow over time. 

- MouseSmoothing=TRUE - This fixes the jittery 3rd person camera movement that is exclusive to the TAKP client. The mouse sensitivity values below are all extensions of this. Make sure they're never set to 0 or else your camera will not move on that axis.
- MouseSensitivityX=0.300000
- MouseSensitivityY=0.300000
- Fov=45.000000
- ChatTimestamps=TRUE - Zeal feature that adds chat timestamps in HH:MM:SS. 
- MouseSensitivityX3rd=0.300000
- MouseSensitivityY3rd=0.300000
- Camera3StrafeEnabled=TRUE 
- Camera4StrafeEnabled=TRUE
- PanDelay=20
- CycleToZealCamEnabled=TRUE
- Bluecon=TRUE - When a mob cons dark blue the text is difficult to read on a black background. This will add a new value to the Options - Color tab with a value of 70.
- ZealInput=TRUE - toggles the zeal input setup for any input in game, giving you a more modern input (ctrl+c, ctrl+v, left, right, shift left+right for highlighting, home, end ect).
- LeftTurnSpellbookAutostand=FALSE
- RightTurnSpellbookAutostand=FALSE
- NetstatVisibilityState=TRUE
- LeftStrafeSpellbookAutostand=TRUE
- RightStrafeSpellbookAutostand=TRUE
- PanDelay=20 - Zeal adds the ability to left click and hold to move the camera in 3rd person without moving the character. To prevent misclicks, you can add a delay to this functionality.

## Controlling your User Interface

The supported client comes with several additional custom UIs. To switch to one of these, run the slash command `/loadskin <ui> 1`. The 1 is optional-- it will keep your current window positions. Loading UIs via the options window will not work. [Source: wiki.takp](https://wiki.takp.info/index.php/Getting_Started_on_Windows#EQClient.ini_settings)

There are several sources to download new User Interface packages, such as [qqui Calmethar](https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=6959), [eqinterface.com](https://eqinterface.com/downloads/index.php?cid=115&dp=0&sh=full&so=desc&sb=lastupdate), or from [#ui-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1162826324092657757). Just make sure to check the date and description for Zeal additions.

### How Do I install an Interface?

1. Download your chosen interface.

2. Find the folder in your EverQuest directory UIFILES inside there will be a folder Default*.

3. Create another folder beside Default, for our example we will call it "BARD" (You can not have spaces in the name). If the file you downloaded already contains a folder, you should skip this step. 

4. Unzip all of the files from your download into the folder "BARD"

5. Login to EverQuest. In game, type `/loadskin BARD`. This will select the BARD UI and load it. The screen will look like your zoning for a moment, then load your new UI modifications. Typing `/loadskin BARD 1`, the 1 is optional-- it will keep your current window positions. Press ALT + O to open the options menu. Navigate to General and select Load UI Skin. Select `BARD` for now and click Load Skin.  

*The default folder CAN NOT be altered in any way. Any changes made to this folder are overwritten  at start up of the game.

### Where should my files be saved?

They should be saved in a single level folder. One of the most common reasons that UIs wont load is that there is a sub-folder inside the Custom UI Folder. Here are two pictures, one showing the wrong way, and one showing the correct way.

### Duplicating your UI Settings for New Characters

Inevitably you'll create multiple characters during your time on Project Quarm. However you do not have to choose a UI and move every window for each character. You can easily copy all of your UI positions by understanding your UI log files. In your TAKP folder you will find files with the naming convention `UI_charactername_pq.proj.ini`. If you identify the one for your main character, the one who has their UI set and all the window positions perfect, you can simply make a copy of this file and rename it to the name of your second character. When you log into the new character, your UI and window positions should now match your first character. 

`UI_Xanax_pq.proj.ini` Copy, Paste `UI_Xanax_pq.proj - Copy.ini` rename to `UI_Xantagonist_pq.proj.ini`

## Characters, Logs, Spell Sets, and Screenshots

### Character ini for Friends Abilities Socials and Macro Settings

The above file duplication and renaming trick we used with our UI settings can be used for other saved settings as well. `charactername_pq.proj.ini` contains all of your friends, ignore, abilities, combat skills, and social macros. Any time you make a new character, you should consider duplicating this file as well and renaming the copy to your new character. The ability and macro copying is a mixed bag, but it's important not to lose your friends. 

### Chat Logs

Everything you see in your chat windows is written to a log file in your TAKP folder. Back in the original EQ days we would delete this every month because the file would get big and make the game act up. Everything you see in this file, the CSR team for Project Quarm can also see and is likely being logged on their end. `eqlog_charactername_pq.proj.txt` is the file that all your chat logs are written to. This can be helpful if you need to pull historical chat conversations, for example. 

### Spell Sets

Zeal has added the ability to make spell sets. Commands in game are as follows:

`/spellset`

- Arguments: save, load, delete
- Example: /spellset save buffs
- Example: /spellset load buffs
- Example: /spellset delete buffs
- Description: allows you to save and load spell sets

Once created, you can even right click your spellbook to choose one of your spell sets from a drop down menu. These values are saved in a new file called `charactername_spellsets.ini`. Within these you can then rename your spellsets or duplicate the file for someone playing the same class as you, for example. 

### Screenshots

Screenshots can be taken by pressing PRINT SCREEN within the game, and can be changed within the Options. These are saved in your TAKP folder as `EQ000001.bmp` for example.
