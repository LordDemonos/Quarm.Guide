## Installing Optional 3rd Party Programs

These programs add functionality not found in the game client by reading your EverQuest player log files. Programs that use hooks to inject code into the game are now allowed, with the one exception being Zeal.

### GINA

A log monitoring application that provides audio and visual feedback based on triggers you either define or import.

- [Official Website](https://eq.gimasoft.com/gina/Default.aspx) | [Supplemental Documentation](https://kingdomdkp.com/index.php/Guides/Tools/How-to-installing-gina--basic-functions.html?)

### EQ Nag

An EverQuest notification agent. An alternative to GINA.

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases) | [Documentation](https://guildantix.github.io/eq-nag/)

### NParse (TAKP Fork)

Provides player location and spell tracking support for TAKP by reading the player log.

### Quarm Tool

Log parser containing 3D Maps, Timers for everything, damage meters, and mob info.

### ZlizEQMap

ZlizEQMap is a map tool mainly designed for servers that emulate old versions of EverQuest. It features a local database of maps from the old EQAtlas website (now hosted on allakabor.com and tessmage.com), along with player positioning (x plotted on map), transparent overlay, waypoints, zone connections, and more.

### Keilly's Supplemental Maps for ZlizEQMap

These are new maps made to work with ZlizEQMap and you'll find your location and coordinates will be more accurate using these over the EQAtlas maps. Maps are for the most part larger than the ones from EQAtlas used in ZlizEQMap, and are best suited for use on a second monitor.

### Quarm+

Quarm+ is a tool built to quickly and painlessly keep Zeal and QuarmTool updated so you can focus on what matters; phat l00t. It asks for your main Project Quarm and QuarmTool directories and saves them to a local settings.json file. Quarm+ is a single button patcher that not only loads the newest versions of Zeal and QuarmTool into your selected directories, but also:

- Allows for installation of older versions through the version selector
- Installs EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml to all UI's installed in the /uifiles/ folder of your main TAKP folder
- Offers compatible UI's to install in /uifiles/ folder for highest level of enjoyment
- Offers a quick and easy Optimize Settings button which applies the most requested optimizations to eqclient.ini

Whether you are in the Discord and up to speed, or you're making the devs scream because you're 10 versions behind, Quarm+ is a tool that can help save you time, worry, and frees you from the lossy streams of #zeal-discussion and #open-source-discussion.

### 4GB Patch

The 4GB Patch is a small tool designed to patch x86 executables, allowing them to access 4GB of virtual memory on x64 platforms instead of the default 2GB. This is particularly useful for applications that require a significant amount of virtual memory, such as games, 3D rendering software, and multimedia applications. The tool is user-friendly, offering both a graphical interface and command line support, and it automatically creates a backup of the original executable.
