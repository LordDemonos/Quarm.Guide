## Installing Optional 3rd Party Programs

These programs add functionality not found in the game client by reading your EverQuest player log files. Programs that use hooks to inject code into the game are now allowed, with the one exception being Zeal.

### GINA

A log monitoring application that provides audio and visual feedback based on triggers you either define or import.

- [Official Website](https://eq.gimasoft.com/gina/Default.aspx) | [Supplemental Documentation](https://kingdomdkp.com/index.php/Guides/Tools/How-to-installing-gina--basic-functions.html?)

### EQ Nag

An EverQuest notification agent. An alternative to GINA.

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases) | [Documentation](https://guildantix.github.io/eq-nag/)

### NParse (TAKP Fork)

Provides player location and spell tracking support for TAKP by reading the player log.

### Quarm Tool

Log parser containing 3D Maps, Timers for everything, damage meters, and mob info.

### ZlizEQMap

ZlizEQMap is a map tool mainly designed for servers that emulate old versions of EverQuest. It features a local database of maps from the old EQAtlas website (now hosted on allakabor.com and tessmage.com), along with player positioning (x plotted on map), transparent overlay, waypoints, zone connections, and more.

### Keilly's Supplemental Maps for ZlizEQMap

These are new maps made to work with ZlizEQMap and you'll find your location and coordinates will be more accurate using these over the EQAtlas maps. Maps are for the most part larger than the ones from EQAtlas used in ZlizEQMap, and are best suited for use on a second monitor.

### Borderless Gaming

Although not used with EverQuest, Borderless Gaming is essential for users with 4k OLED monitors to eliminate the Windows border around games, which helps prevent OLED burn-in. While the application is available for purchase on Steam, it can also be obtained for free on GitHub.

### Quick Quarm

[Quick Quarm](https://github.com/ryhoneyman/quick-quarm) provides a streamlined method to deploy a single-host Quarm EQEmu server. It is particularly useful for personal projects or developers looking to test new patches and modifications in the game environment.

Loot Buddy is a comprehensive tool designed for Project Quarm, facilitating the management of auction and vendor prices, item type information, and group or raid loot notifications. It offers customizable notifications and parameters to enhance the user's gaming experience.

### 4GB Patch

The 4GB Patch is a small tool designed to patch x86 executables, allowing them to access 4GB of virtual memory on x64 platforms instead of the default 2GB. This is particularly useful for applications that require a significant amount of virtual memory, such as games, 3D rendering software, and multimedia applications. The tool is user-friendly, offering both a graphical interface and command line support, and it automatically creates a backup of the original executable.
