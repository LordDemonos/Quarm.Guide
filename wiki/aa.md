# About Alternate Advancement

The alternative advancement system is a non-level-based advancement option for those level 51 and above. It was originally one of the features of EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin.

There are a very large number of alternate advancement abilities, which you can buy with AA points. In order to attain these points, you can toggle your experience into the alternative advancement pool. (This can be done by hitting the default of **V**, or by going into the inventory window and using the 'Alt. Adv' button.)

When you do this, your experience will be allocated to this pool in lieu of your "leveling" experience bar. Switching between the two pools will not cause you to lose experience, and experience loss due to death suffered by the character will always be taken from the "Leveling" experience pool, and will never impact your alternative advancement pool.

The AA window is reached through the inventory window. Every class has their AA's separated into three tabs: the general tab that all classes share, the archetype tab which each archetype (fighter, caster, priest, hybrid) shares, and the class AA tab, which is specific to each class and described on their respective pages.

The column on the far right is the `/alt activate` number for the ability. The command to use these would be `/alt activate <ability number>`. This allows you to make a macro with the ability in it and add a message or chain abilities, etc.

<div style="background-color: #fff5f5; border: 2px solid #dc3545; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">
⚠️ <strong>A word of warning on AA's</strong> - TAKP is a snapshot in time. Some AA's may not act the way you expect or do anything at all for your class, so tread carefully. More details here: <a href="/baa/" title="AA's that will remain broken/useless or act differently than you expect" style="color: #dc3545; text-decoration: underline;">AA's that will remain broken/useless or act differently than you expect</a>. Those specific AA's are marked in red below.
