also find them up on the wall in the middle of the zone.

guards in that hall (There are 3 PH’s in total). He may not be up 
immediately, but the guards should respawn every 10-12ish minutes on 
their own. If they aren’t respawning, kill them and wait for repops.

## Part 4

![](/assets/images/Sigil-Earring-4.png)
This part of the quest also gives you the![](/assets/images/Stone-Key.png)Arx Key, which grants access to**Lord Seru’s**area.**Part 4**is the only part required if you are going for the![](/assets/images/Stone-Key.png)Arx Key. You need to complete all steps if you intend to get the earring.

**1)**You’ll need to kill four mini-raid mobs in**Sanctus Seru**. They each drop a “**shard**” to loot. They spawn on the top floor in the 4 inner temples in the middle of the zone.

Praesertum Bikun= NW =**Shard of the Shoulder**Praesertum Vantorus= SW =**Shard of the Hand**Praesertum Rhugol= NE =**Shard of the Eye**Praesertum Matpa= SE =Shard of the Heart

![](/assets/images/Bikun.jpg)![](/assets/images/Vantorus.jpg)![](/assets/images/Rhugol.jpg)![](/assets/images/Matpa.jpg)
These mobs all cast a “punt” spell roughly every 5 seconds that punts
 a player (you’ll get a loading screen) to the “jail” part of the zone. 
You can out range this spell when pulling the mobs initially, but if you
 are too close or are fighting the mob, you’ll get punted. The punt has a
 long range so it can be tricky to pull them if you have not done it 
before.

A general safe strategy (in era) is to pull the mobs to the jail cell
 in which they punt you. This way you will get punted to where the fight
 is already happening. You can see the jail location in the map below.

Additionally,Praesertum Matpa**(gnome)**gates, so be sure to mana burn him while fighting. I’d recommended 
having at least 10 decently geared chars at level 65 due to how often 
they punt. More people may be required in Luclin Era.

**2)**Once you have looted all4x shardshead to**Katta Castellum**and find**Elnerick Augustleaf**.

![](/assets/images/Elnerick-Augustleaf-Map.png)![](/assets/images/Elnerick-Augustleaf.jpg)

**Seal of Katta**is used in the**Sigil Earring of Veracity**quest, while![](/assets/images/Stone-Key.png)Arx Keywill allow you to port your group up to**Seru’s Lair.**

**3)**Find**Lcea Katta**. She is in the same building as**Elnerick Augustleaf**.

From the castle entrance, go up 
the stairs straight ahead, take a left up the second small stair case, 
go into the hall with a mirror at the end, take a left, straight ahead 
at the podium you’ll seeLcea Katta(if she is up).
