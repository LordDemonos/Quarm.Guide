## [SoulFire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5504)
[SoulFire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5504) is the first sword required for the Paladin Epic.

### Step 1
You'll first want to get faction with [Priests of Life](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/341). This will be needed for the final turn in later. High Kindly was sufficient for me, but you may be able to do it with less (exact amount unverified).

There are 4 Options. The first two are good. The last two are slow.

#### Option A - GOOD OPTION #1

You can get faction by questing with [Lashun Novashine](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/2032) in [North Qeynos](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/2). He roams around the zone, so a tracker might help speed things up. However, the zone is not very big so you'll run into him eventually. You can either give him 2 Gold or 2 Bone Chips to receive 1 faction. The benefit of using Bone Chips is that you can turn-in an unlimited amount at a time (stacked). With Gold you can only turn in 2 at a time. You can con him to check your faction status with [Priests of Life](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/341).

![Lashun-Novashine.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Lashun-Novashine.jpg)

#### Option B - GOOD OPTION #2

You must be at least AMIABLE with [Priests of Life](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/341) to use this option

Go to [North Qeynos](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/2). Kill a [Koalindl](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/2005) (with an alt or a character OTHER than your Paladin. You will take a big faction hit if you use your Paladin) who spawn in the water underneath the Temple of Life. Loot [Koalindl Fish](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13383) with your Paladin. Common Drop. The fish are level 1. 

[Koalindl](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/2005) Fish is NO TRADE, so you'll still need to loot it on the character you are doing the quest with.

![a-Koalindl-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-Koalindl-Map.jpg)
![a-Koalindl-faction-hit.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-Koalindl-faction-hit.jpg)

Give [Koalindl Fish](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13383) to [Enic Ruklin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/2039) nearby in the Temple of Life to receive +100 [Priests of Life](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/341) faction. You must be at least AMIABLE to do this turn-in.

![Enic-Ruklin.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Enic-Ruklin.png)
![pally-faction-turnin.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/pally-faction-turnin.png)

Option C and D are almost not worth mentioning, but are mostly as an FYI:

#### Option C - SLOW + Expensive
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/northkarana/Fixxin_Followig)

You can also give [Silver Bar](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16500) to [Fixxin Followig](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/13063) in [North Karana](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/13) for 1 faction per bar. You can also only turn in 1 at a time since he gives a Lore book. He roams along the north side of the zone.

#### Option D - SLOW

There are also various NPC's you can kill to get faction, the most notable one is [Lord Grimrot](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/14143) in [South Karana](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/14) and various NPC's in [Qeynos Catacomb](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/45)s. I won't go over all NPCs since the best Option is Option A.

### Step 2
Once you have obtained High Kindly with [Priests of Life](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/341) faction go to [Castle Mistmoore](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/59). You need to kill [Xicotl](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/59152) and loot [Glowing Sword Hilt](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12197). He spawns in the "Spa" room (-190, +95). His PH is a Mistmoore guard. You do not need to kill a Mistmoore guard. It will automatically respawn every minute or so. Eventually [Xicotl](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/59152) will spawn in its place.

![Xicotl-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Xicotl-Map.jpg)
![a-Mistmoore-guard.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-Mistmoore-guard.jpg)
![Xicotl.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Xicotl.jpg)

### Step 3
Go to [North Ro](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/34) and kill [tarantula](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/34060) type mobs until you get [Spider Venom Sac](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/14018).

![a-dune-turantula.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-dune-turantula.jpg)

### Step 4
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/ecommons/Altunic_Jartin)

Go to [Eastern Commonlands](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/22) and buy [Cloth Shirt](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1004) from [Germe Threadspinner](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/22099). He is inside a hut along the north wall.

Next, find [Altunic Jartin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/22069) (also in [Eastern Commonlands](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/22)) who wanders around the zone.  Sometimes he is along the road, sometimes he is in the grassy area. A tracker can speeds things up a bit. Give [Altunic Jartin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/22069) [Cloth Shirt](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1004) to receive [Token of Generosity](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13865).

![Commonlands-Map-Paladin-Epic.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Commonlands-Map-Paladin-Epic.png)
![Germe-Threadspinner.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Germe-Threadspinner.jpg)
![Altunic-Jartin.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Altunic-Jartin.jpg)

Note: To give the tunic to [Altunic Jartin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/22069) you'll need to be at least Amiable faction with [Knights of Truth](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/281). If you are Mithaniel Marr deity you may already be Amiable. If you are a different deity then you may be a bit low. To raise your faction kill Freeport Militia Guards in either Commonlands or Freeport. 

Some easy faction grinding options:

[Eastern Commonlands](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/22)
Guards give between 1-10 each (depending on which guard)

[East Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/10)
Level 35-40ish Guards generally give +5-10 each.

[Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9018): +200  Killing this guy is also a required part of the quest (See Step 11). Level 48. He also has a longer respawn than most guards so may not be up if someone has just killed him. 4 hour respawn? Blue Circle on map below

[Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9147): (undead version): +100 - Spawns after [Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9018) dies. Level 40.

[Guard Drazden](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9025): +40 - In [Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9018)'s room. Approx. 4 min 50 sec respawn. Level 40.

[Brother Jentry](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9024): +40 - In [Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9018)'s room. Approx. 4 min 50 sec respawn. Level 40.

![Sir-Lucan-DLere-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Sir-Lucan-DLere-Map.jpg)
![Sir-Lucan-DLere.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Sir-Lucan-DLere.jpg)

### Step 5
Next you'll need to farm 3 items: [Rat Ears](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13072), [Fire Beetle Eye](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10307), [Snake Scales](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13070). These items will used in 21 trivial trade skill combine, so grab more than 1 if you aren't feeling lucky. You can get these from mobs in either [Eastern Commonlands](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/22) or [West Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/9) (Rats, Fire Beetles, and Snakes).

![a-fire-beetle.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-fire-beetle.jpg)
![a-large-rat.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-large-rat.jpg)
![a-large-rattlesnake.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-large-rattlesnake.jpg)

### Step 6
Get a [Water Flask](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13006) and a [Bottle](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16598) from a vendor somewhere, they are sold in every town.

### Step 7
Use the materials you just got to make the following items: [Bog Juice](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16581) and [Edible Goo](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13498).

[Bog Juice](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16581) - Brewing - Trivial 21 - Brew Barrel
1x [Water Flask](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13006)
1x [Bottle](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16598)
1x [Snake Scales](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13070)

[Edible Goo](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13498) - Baking - Trivial 21 - Oven
1x [Fire Beetle Eye](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10307)
1x  [Rat Ears](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13072)

### Step 8
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/freportn/Merko_Quetalis)

Go to the Halls of Truth in [North Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/8). Find [Merko Quetalis](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/8044) (use find, +1000, -140). Give him [Spider Venom Sac](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/14018) to receive [Token of Bravery](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12144). Next, give him the [Token of Bravery](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12144) you just got along with [Token of Generosity](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13865). This turn-in will spawn [Guard Willia](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/8110) (+850, -220)  in the basement/cell area.

[Guard Willia](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/8110) is level 6. Kill him and loot [Token of Truth](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13866). Go back to [Merko Quetalis](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/8044) and give him [Token of Truth](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13866) to receive [Testimony](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18828).

![Merko-Quetalis-Map2.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Merko-Quetalis-Map2.jpg)
![Merko-Quetalis.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Merko-Quetalis.jpg)
![Guard-Willia-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Guard-Willia-Map.jpg)
![Guard-Willia.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Guard-Willia.jpg)

### Step 9
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/freporte/Tykar_Renlin)

Go to [East Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/10) and find [Gregor Nasin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10171). Buy 4x [Drom's Champagne](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13829) from him. You will need to turn them into [Tykar Renlin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10157). [Tykar Renlin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10157) has 4 PH's that all spawn at the same spot at the bar. These PH's they will roam around Freeport for a bit, then come back and eventually despawn/respawn. Basically you will just need to wait for [Tykar Renlin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10157) to spawn on his own. They can take anywhere from 1 to 6 min to respawn (roughly). Known PH's are: [Plnorrick Spinecracker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10163), [Biggle Lombokker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10160), [Tlin Bowfright](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10186), and [Lozani](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10156).

Once [Tykar Renlin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/10157) finally does spawn, give him 1x [Drom's Champagne](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13829) at a time, after the 4th one he will give you [Bunker Cell #1](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12196).

![Gregor-Nasin-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Gregor-Nasin-Map.jpg)
![Tykar-Renlin.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Tykar-Renlin.jpg)
![Gregor-Nasin.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Gregor-Nasin.jpg)

### Step 10

[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/freportw/a_prisoner)

Stay in [West Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/9). Find [a prisoner](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9138) in the arena area. Give him [Bog Juice](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/16581), [Edible Goo](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13498) and [Bunker Cell #1](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12196) to receive [H.K. 102](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12143).

![a-prisoner-map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-prisoner-map.jpg)
![a-prisoner.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/a-prisoner.jpg)

### Step 11
Still in [East Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/10), you must now kill [Sir Lucan D'Lere](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/9018). Doing so will make you instant KOS to Freeport. He is level 46-48 range. Once he dies, an undead version of him will spawn. Kill it too. Loot [Testimony of Truth](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18827). 

![Sir-Lucan-DLere-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Sir-Lucan-DLere-Map.jpg)
![Sir-Lucan-DLere-Skeleton.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Sir-Lucan-DLere-Skeleton.jpg)
![Sir-Lucan-DLere.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Sir-Lucan-DLere.jpg)

### Step 12
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/freportn/Valeron_Dushire)

Zone over to [North Freeport](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/8) and locate [Valeron Dushire](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/8077) (+1120, -500) in Hall of Truth. Give him [Testimony of Truth](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18827) to receive [Brilliant Sword of Faith](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13947).

![Valeron-Dushire-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Valeron-Dushire-Map.jpg)
![Valeron-Dushire.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Valeron-Dushire.jpg)

### Step 13
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/highkeep/Bank_Clerk_Jaylin)

Go to [High Keep](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/6) and find [Bank Clerk Jaylin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/6059) (-40, -335) near the bank. Give her [H.K. 102](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12143) to receive [Sealed Note](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18932). 

![Assistant-Kiolna-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Assistant-Kiolna-Map.jpg)
![Assistant-Kiolna.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Assistant-Kiolna.jpg)

### Step 14 - Final Turn-in
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/paw/Brother_Hayle)

You're looking for [Brother Hayle](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/18071). Depending on the era your server is in he will be in different places:

![Brother-Hayle-Map-Splitpaw.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Brother-Hayle-Map-Splitpaw.png)

You can find him in [Splitpaw Lair](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/18) in a jail cell (+382,+327) . On your way in there are some levers on the walls to open up the cell doors.

![Brother-Hayle-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Brother-Hayle-Map.jpg)
![Brother-Hayle.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Brother-Hayle.jpg)

Make sure you are at least Kindly (I was high Kindly) faction with him.

1. First give him [Sealed Note](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18932) by itself. He will return [Note](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18937).

2. Then give him [Glowing Sword Hilt](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12197), [Brilliant Sword of Faith](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13947), [Testimony](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18828), [Note](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18937) to receive [SoulFire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5504)!

![SoulFire-Stats.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/SoulFire-Stats.jpg)

## [Ghoulbane](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5403)
The second sword you'll need to obtain to get your epic is [Ghoulbane](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5403). There are 3 options to get one. I highly recommend Option 1

### Step 15

#### Option 1
Kill [Joren Nobleheart](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/62000) in [South Felwithe](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/62). Always drops. This is by far the easiest path but requires a few people to kill him in Kunark era. He is level 60. Other NPC's do not assist. He does not have any faction hits. He melees for just under 200. You can reach him by taking the middle teleport pad.

![Joren-Nobleheart-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Joren-Nobleheart-Map.jpg)
![Joren-Nobleheart.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Joren-Nobleheart.jpg)

#### Option 2
Kill the [froglok shin lord](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/65128) in [Upper Guk](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/65). Rare Drop. This is easily soloable but the [froglok shin lord](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/65128)  is a rare spawn and the [Ghoulbane](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5403) is a rare drop. He spawns in the most southwestern room of the zone.  It is level 30.

![the-froglok-shin-lord-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/the-froglok-shin-lord-Map.jpg)
![the-froglok-shin-lord.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/the-froglok-shin-lord.jpg)

#### Option 3
You can also quest for [Ghoulbane](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5403). Due to the time this quest can take I will not be going over this option at all. Option 1 and 2 are much faster. The quest is given by [Ryshon Hunsti](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/12081) in [West Karana](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/12).

![Ghoulbane-Stats.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Ghoulbane-Stats.jpg)

## [Fiery Avenger](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/11050)
You must have both [SoulFire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5504) and [Ghoulbane](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5403) to complete this quest.

### Step 16
You will need to get faction (Ally recommended) with [Deepwater Knights](https://www.pqdi.cc/faction/242). Luckily this doesn't take very long! There are three methods you can use. However, the first one is vastly superior to the other two.

* Method 1. Kill [Atdehim Sqonci](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/75019) in [Paineel](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/75). He gives +1000 faction and is on a roughly 5 minute respawn. Kill him a couple times to max your faction! He is level 45, fairly easy kill, and located inside the Cleric Guild. One other level 35 NPC next to him will aggro as well.

![Atdehim-Sqonci-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Atdehim-Sqonci-Map.jpg)
![Atdehim-Sqonci.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Atdehim-Sqonci.jpg)
![Atdehim-Sqonci-Faction.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Atdehim-Sqonci-Faction.png)

* Method 2. Alternatively, you can kill Skeleton Guards in [Paineel](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/75). Each kill gives 10 faction. The two in the noob yard instantly respawn. They are level 10 but hit for 120 and have a few thousand hp. You can also go into [Paineel](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/75) and kill guards, whom are weaker, but don't respawn instantly.

![Paineel-Guards.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Paineel-Guards.jpg)

* Method 3. Kill Kobolds in [The Warrens](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/101). Loot [Kobold Molar](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1761). They are very common. They do not stack so you'll need a lot of bag space. Turn them into [Tiam Khonsir](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/24053) in [Erudin](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/24). You will get 5 or 6 faction  per turn-in. This method is the slowest of the three.

![The-Warrens.png](/assets/images/epics/paladin/The-Warrens.png)
![Tiam-Khonsir.jpg](/assets/images/epics/paladin/Tiam-Khonsir.jpg)

### Step 17
Loot Torn, [Frost-Covered Book](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/19070) from any of the following:

* [Gorenaire](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/86000) in [Dreadlands](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/86)

### Step 20
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/everfrost/Lich_of_Miragul)

Head to [Everfrost](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/30). You will need to find an opening in the frozen lake and swim to the underwater tunnels. You are looking for [Lich of Miragul](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/30093). He roams around in the caves. He will con as "KOS", however he doesn't attack and you shouldn't need to charm him to do the turn-in. I was able to hand it in with no problems. Give him [Miragul](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/30094)'s Phylactery to spawn [Miragul](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/30094). Kill [Miragul](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/30094) and loot [Miragul's Head](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/19073) and [Miragul's Robe](https://www.pqdi.cchttps://www.pqdi.cc/item/1254).

* First, go to the Quest Room. You can buy Efreeti's Key from Key Master on Island 1 to access it.

[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/air_instanced/Dason_Goldblade)
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/airplane/Dirkog_Steelhand)

* Say "I wish to be tested by Dirkog" to [Dason Goldblade](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71037) in the Quest Room. [Dason Goldblade](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71037) will give you [Walk with Evil](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18527).

    Give [Walk with Evil](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18527) back to [Dason Goldblade](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71037) to spawn [Dirkog Steelhand](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71077). Give [Dirkog Steelhand](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71077) 500pp. Doing so will spawn [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091) in the Windmill on Island 4.

    Note 1: [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091) only stays up for approx 3.5 minutes, so get to him quickly if you do not have a friend to help spawn him.

    Note 2: You can have a friend spawn [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091) from the quest room if needed. Make sure you are in the same group since the NPC will be loot locked. Also to avoid any potential aggro issues, ensure no other NPC's or players are in the Windmill or near its entrance before spawning [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091).

* Head to up Island 4 
* [Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/air_instanced/Inte_Akera)

    - First, give [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091) [SoulFire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/5504) to receive [Inte's First Blessing](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18033).

    - Finally, give [Inte Akera](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/71091) [Inte's First Blessing](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18033), [Inte's Second Blessing](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18034), [Miragul](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/30094)'s Robe, [Miragul's Head](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/19073) to receive [Fiery Avenger](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/11050)!
