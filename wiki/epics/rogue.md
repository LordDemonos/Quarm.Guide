## Pre-Farmable Items:
##### [Stained Parchment Top](/item/28010)
##### [Stained Parchment Bottom](/item/28011)
##### [Book of Souls](/item/28016)
##### 2 x [Bottle of Milk](/item/13087)
##### 100pp
##### [Step 6](#step-6) - 4 Robes
##### [Step 8](#step-8) - 4 Weapons

### [Stained Parchment Top](/item/28010)
You will need some pick pocketing skill. 190 confirmed working.

Head to [North Kaladim](/zone/67) and pickpocket the dwarven Rogue Guildmaster [Founy Jestands](/npc/67000) until you receive [Stained Parchment Top](/item/28010). He will not always have it on him so your strategy here is going to be to pickpocket him until you get roughly 20 fails in a row (assuming your skill is high). Usually you'll get platinum/gold and some other miscellaneous items. Once you think he has no more items on him, come back an hour or two later and repeat the process until you get [Stained Parchment Top](/item/28010).

If he aggros on you, just zone over into [South Kaladim](/zone/60). He despawns around 7PM and respawns around 9PM in-game time.  Also, if you are an evil race, it's helpful to have an illusion mask for a good race so you aren't KoS. 25% chance of having the item.

### [Stained Parchment Bottom](/item/28011)
You will need some pick pocketing skill. 190 confirmed working.

The same strategy applies here. Pickpocket [Tani N'Mar](/npc/42000) in [Neriak Third Gate](/zone/42) until you feel he has nothing left, then come back an hour or two later and repeat the process until you get [Stained Parchment Bottom](/item/28011). 

If he aggros be ready for a long run back to the zone in. It is recommended to stand on the steps behind him while pick pocketing. He despawns around 7PM and respawns around 9PM in-game time. Having a Dark Elf illusion mask is beneficial here as well if you are KoS to Dark Elves. 35% chance of having the item.

### [Book of Souls](/item/28016)
[Book of Souls](/item/28016) can be found in [Plane of Hate](/zone/76). It is a ground spawn at (-58.0, 325.0) on top of a dresser. Roughly 5 minute re-spawn. You can sneak/hide to it. It is in the upstairs area of the Maestro castle - entrance to castle is at (101.0, 57.0).  Walk in, turn right, and take the ramp up to the second level.

### 2 x [Bottle](/item/16598) of Milk
Buy 2 x [Bottle of Milk](/item/13087) from a Baking Vendor.  Don't drink them!

## The Quest

### Step 1
[Script Page](/script-entities/highpass/Stanos_Herkanor)

Now we can begin the quest. Head to [Highpass Hold](/zone/5) and speak to [Anson McBale](/npc/5037) located at (325.0, 5.0). He is in a hidden area of the zone that is only accessible by an underwater tunnel.

Say `I need to see Stanos` to  [Anson McBale](/npc/5037) (must have Amiable or better faction with [Highpass Guards](/faction/332)) to spawn [Stanos Herkanor](/npc/5088). Give [Stanos Herkanor](/npc/5088) [Stained Parchment Top](/item/28010) and [Stained Parchment Bottom](/item/28011) to receive   [Combined Parchment](/item/28012).

### Step 2
[Script Page](/script-entities/lakerathe/[Eldreth](/npc/51025))

Head to [Lake Rathetear](/zone/51) and find [Eldreth](/npc/51025) (2623.0, -550.0). Give him [Combined Parchment](/item/28012), 2x [Bottle of Milk](/item/13087), and 100pp to receive [Scribbled Parchment](/item/28053).

![Eldreth.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Eldreth.jpg)

### Step 3
[Script Page](/script-entities/steamfont/Yendar_Starpyre)

1. Head to [Steamfont Mountains](/zone/56) and find [Yendar Starpyre](/npc/56012) - he roams a bit, check along the blue line on his page.

2. Give [Yendar Starpyre](/npc/56012) the [Scribbled Parchment]((/item/28053)) to receive [Tattered Parchment](/item/28055).

3. Next give [Yendar Starpyre](/npc/56012) the [Book of Souls](/item/28016) along with the [Tattered Parchment](/item/28055) you just got. This depawns [Yendar Starpyre](/npc/56012) and spawns [Renux Herkanor](/npc/56172). Kill her (bring some friends). Loot [Translated Parchment](/item/18961).

**Renux has a 100% chance to drop the [Jagged [Diamond](/item/10037) Dagger](/item/7506) used in [Step 8](#step-8).**

![Renux-Herkanor.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Renux-Herkanor.jpg)

### Step 4
[Script Page](/script-entities/highpass/Stanos_Herkanor)

Head back to [Highpass Hold](/zone/5) and give [Translated Parchment](/item/18961) to [Stanos Herkanor](/npc/5088) to receive [Sealed Box](/item/28057).  

![Anson-McBale-Loc.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Anson-McBale-Loc.jpg)
![Stanos.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Stanos.jpg)

### Step 5
[Script Page](/script-entities/kithicor/%23Adjutant_D-kan)

Go to [Kithicor](/zone/20) Forest. Give the [Sealed Box](/item/28057) to any of the Dark Elves at the Cabin Ruins to spawn [General V'ghera](/npc/20205) at (827, 2297). These mobs only spawn at night. He hits fairly fast and everything in the cabin will assist when he's pulled. Bring a lot of friends.

Once he's dead, loot [Generals Pouch](/item/28013).

**General has a 25% chance to drop the [Cazic Quill](/item/7505) used in [Step 7](#step-7).**

![General.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/General.jpg)
![Generals-Pouch.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Generals-Pouch.jpg)

### Step 6
Collect these 4 robes (unless you have a [Cazic Quill](/item/7505) already):

* [Robe of the Kedge](/item/1253)
* [Robe of the Ishva](/item/1357) (tradable)
* [Shining Metallic Robes](/item/1360) (tradable)
* [Robe of the Oracle](/item/1354) (tradable)

### Step 7
[Script Page](/script-entities/qey2hh1/Vilnius_the_Small)

**Move on if you already have a [Cazic Quill](/item/7505)**

Head to [West Karana](/zone/12) and find [Vilnius the Small](/npc/12019). He is a Barbarian on a small hill that spawns at night. A brigand takes his place during the day. You do not need to kill the brigand. It will despawn at night and [Vilnius the Small](/npc/12019) will take his place a few (in game) hours later.

Give [Vilnius the Small](/npc/12019) [Robe of the Kedge](/item/1253), [Robe of the Ishva](/item/1357), [Shining Metallic Robes](/item/1360), and [Robe of the Oracle](/item/1354) to receive [Cazic Quill](/item/7505).

![Vilnius-the-Small.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Vilnius-the-Small.jpg)

### Step 8
[Script Page](/script-entities/qey2hh1/Vilnius_the_Small)

**Move on if you already have a [Jagged Diamond Dagger](/item/7506)**

Collect these 4 items:

* [Fleshripper](/item/5411)
* [Painbringer](/item/5410)
* [A Gigantic Zweihander](/item/5308) (tradable)
* [A Mithril Two-Handed Sword](/item/5401) (tradable)

Give all 4 items to [Vilnius the Small](/npc/12019) in [West Karana](/zone/12) to receive [Jagged Diamond Dagger](/item/7506). See [Step 7](#step-7) for how to spawn him.

![Vilnius-the-Small.jpg](/assets/images/epics/rogue/Vilnius-the-Small.jpg)

### Step 9
[Script Page](/script-entities/highpass/Stanos_Herkanor)

Go back to [Highpass Hold](/zone/5) and spawn [Stanos Herkanor](/npc/5088) for a final time. Say `I need to see Stanos` to [Anson McBale](/npc/5037) if [Stanos Herkanor](/npc/5088) is not already up.

Give him:

* [Cazic Quill](/item/7505)
* [Generals Pouch](/item/28013)
* [Jagged Diamond Dagger](/item/7506)

>Very well done. I leave now to confront Hanns with this evidence. Even so, it will not be easy to regain his trust. That is why I need those daggers, in case all else fails. Bristlebane grant me luck - I can no longer live like a hunted dog. In any case, I am grateful for your aid. Take this wretched blade, I can bear it no longer. I must warn you, I feel it carries [Innoruuk](/npc/76326)'s curse; all who are near it learn the meaning of hate. Ironic, isn't it? You went to all that work to redeem yourself for a rapier, yet the true reward came when you redeemed another. . Good luck, Soandso, for much as I, you will need it.

Receive [Ragebringer](/item/11057)!
