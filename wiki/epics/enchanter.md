### Step 1A
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/qcat/Reania_Jukle)

Go to the [Qeynos Catacombs](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/45) and find [Reania Jukle](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/45082) (Enchnater Guildmaster) at +390, -390. The easiest way to get to her is to enter the [Qeynos Catacombs](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/45) from the warrior arena area in [South Qeynos](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/1).
Say "find your own supply" to receive [Empty Ink Vial](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10626).

![Reania-Jukle-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Reania-Jukle-Map.jpg)
![Reania-Jukle.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Reania-Jukle.jpg)

### Step 1B
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/gukbottom/a_ghoul_scribe)

Go to [Lower Guk](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/66) and charm [a ghoul scribe](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/66170). Give him [Empty Ink Vial](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10626) to receive [Ink of the Dark](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10601). To avoid the other frogs killing him while he's charmed you can mez him first, kill the adds, then charm him afterwards.

![a-ghoul-scribe-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/a-ghoul-scribe-Map.jpg)
![a-ghoul-scribe-PH.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/a-ghoul-scribe-PH.jpg)

### Step 1C
Loot [Shining Metallic Robes](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1360) (tradable) from either the [ghoul arch magus](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/66156) or from [Yendar Starpyre](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/56012). the [ghoul arch magus](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/66156) is a rare spawn in [Lower Guk](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/66), his PH is a kor ghoul wizard. The Robe is his rare drop. [Yendar Starpyre](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/56012)  is a roaming level 65 gnome in [Steamfont Mountains](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/56). He always drops the robe. If you have a few friends to help, it's easier to kill [Yendar Starpyre](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/56012). The robe is tradable as well, so check the Bazaar.

![the-ghoul-arch-magus.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/the-ghoul-arch-magus.jpg)

![Yendar-Starpyre.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Yendar-Starpyre.jpg)

### Step 1D
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/akanon/Rilgor_Plegnog)

Give [Shining Metallic Robes](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1360) to [Rilgor Plegnog](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/55121) (Enchanter Guildmaster) in the north area of [Ak'Anon](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/55) to receive [Mechanical Pen](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10600). You can use "Find" to locate him.

![Rilgor-Plegnog-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Rilgor-Plegnog-Map.jpg)
![Rilgor-Plegnog.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Rilgor-Plegnog.jpg)

### Step 1E
Purchase [Quill](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13051) and [Piece of Parchment](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13063) from a vendor. The vendor I used was [Hanlore Escaval](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/1052) (+300, -570) in [South Qeynos](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/1).

[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/qey2hh1/Chrislin_Baker)

Give both [Quill](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13051) and [Piece of Parchment](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/13063) to [Chrislin Baker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/12074) in [West Karana](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/12). She is located inside a hut. She will despawn and give you a [bandit sash](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/12100), which is not used for this quest. However, this turn-in also triggers [Thrackin Griften](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/12001) ( +860, -11570) to spawn across the zone. Kill him and loot [White Paper](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10602).

[Thrackin Griften](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/12001) is level 55, 20K HP, Hits 150+, and somewhat resistant to spells.

![Thrackin-Griften.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Thrackin-Griften.jpg)

### Step 1F
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/erudnext/Stofo_Olan)

Go to [Erudin](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/24) and find [Stofo Olan](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/24013). He is inside the Vastly Deep Inn on the 2nd floor, last door on the right. Give him [Ink of the Dark](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10601), [Mechanical Pen](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10600), [White Paper](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10602) to receive [Copy of Notes](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10603).

![Stofo-Olan.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Stofo-Olan.jpg)

### Step 1G
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/burningwood/a_sarnak_imitator)

Go to [Burning Woods](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/87) and find [a sarnak imitator](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/87001) (-1200, -4000). Give him  [Copy of Notes](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10603) to receive [Jeb's Seal](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10604).

![a-sarnak-imitator-map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/a-sarnak-imitator-map.jpg)
![a-sarnak-imitator.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/a-sarnak-imitator.jpg)

## First Piece of Staff

### Step 2A
Go to [East Cabilis](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/106) and kill [Vessel Drozlin](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/106007). Loot [Xolion Rod](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10606). He is located in the sewers. In order to access the sewers you need to run through the red glowing wall in the Shaman Guild Master area, then go down a series of ladders. Make sure you have levitate as well. When you get to the 4 way cross-road, take the right path and levitate across the pit. He can run at low hp so the best strat is to pull him into the nearby water so that he does not path back through the 1-way hidden walls when he runs.

![Vessel-Drozlin-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Vessel-Drozlin-Map.jpg)
![Vessel-Drozlin.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Vessel-Drozlin.jpg)

### Step 2B
Go to [Neriak Third Gate](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/42) and kill [Verina Tomb](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/42112). Loot [Innoruuk's Word](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10607). She spawns in the Cleric Guild Master area in the first section of the zone.

![Verina-Tomb-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Verina-Tomb-Map.jpg)
![Verina-Tomb.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Verina-Tomb.jpg)

### Step 2C
Go to [Chardok](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/103) and kill [Prince Selrach Di'Zok](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/103080). Loot [Head of a Prince](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10627). Respawn time 2 hours. Level 61. A group of PoP geared players should be able to kill him with ease. You'll need a picklock to open his door.

[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/felwitheb/Joren_Nobleheart)

Find [Joren Nobleheart](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/62000) in [Southern Felwithe](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/62). In the teleport pad room, take the one straight ahead. Give him [Head of a Prince](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10627) to receive [Chalice of Kings](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10608).

![Prince-Selrach-DiZok-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Prince-Selrach-DiZok-Map.jpg)
![Prince-Selrach-DiZok.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Prince-Selrach-DiZok.jpg)

![Joren-Nobleheart.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Joren-Nobleheart.jpg)

### Step 2D
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/oggok/Bozlum_Blossom)

Go to [Oggok](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/49). Look for the ground spawn [Large Muddy Sandals](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10628) at +220, +370. Next, find [Bozlum Blossom](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/49023) (in [Oggok](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/49)) and give her the [Large Muddy Sandals](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10628) to receive [Scribbled Parchment](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10629).

[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/oggok/Brokk_Boxtripper)

Find [Brokk Boxtripper](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/49061), who is right next to where you just picked up the ground spawn. Give him
[Scribbled Parchment](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10629) to receive [Gift to Bozlum](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10630). Go back to [Bozlum Blossom](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/49023) and give her [Gift to Bozlum](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10630) to receive [Snow Blossoms](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10609).

![Oggok-Map-Enchanter-1.0.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Oggok-Map-Enchanter-1.0.jpg)
![Large-Muddy-Sandals.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Large-Muddy-Sandals.jpg)
![Bozlum-Blossom.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Bozlum-Blossom.jpg)

### Step 2E
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/overthere/Modani_Qu-Loni)

Go to [The Overthere](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/93) and find [Modani Qu'Loni](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/93001). He is located in an underground tunnel in the Gorge. Give him [Jeb's Seal](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10604). He will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive [Enchanters Sack](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17861).

Combine [Xolion Rod](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10606), [Innoruuk](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/76326)'s Word, [Chalice of Kings](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10608), [Snow Blossoms](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10609) in [Enchanters Sack](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17861) to receive [Sack for Modani](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10635).

![Modani-QuLoni.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Modani-QuLoni.jpg)

## Second Piece of Staff

### Step 3A
Go to [Oasis of Marr](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/37) and Kill [Cazel](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/37157). Loot [Spoon](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10614). Always Drops. He roams all around the desert area of the zone. He has a high regeneration rate, but is an easy kill with a few people in era. Hits for 200's.

![Cazel.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Cazel.jpg)

### Step 3B
Go to [The Overthere](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/93) and pick up the ground spawn [The One Key](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10615). You'll need levitate as it's located on a small plateau coming out of the canyon.

![The-One-Key.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/The-One-Key.jpg)

### Step 3C
Go to [Dalnir](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/104) and find the ground spawn [Lost Scroll](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10616). Getting there is a bit tricky if you are not familiar with the zone, you'll need to drop down a tomb and go through a fake wall.

![Dalnir-Tomb-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Dalnir-Tomb-Map.jpg)
![Dalnir-Tomb2.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Dalnir-Tomb2.jpg)

### Step 3D
Head to Quest Island in [Plane of Sky](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/71). In the corner of the room on a table you'll find the ground spawn [Charm and Sacrifice](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10617).

![Charm-and-Sacrifice-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Charm-and-Sacrifice-Map.jpg)
![Charm-and-Sacrifice.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Charm-and-Sacrifice.jpg)

### Step 3E
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/akanon/Clockwork_VIIX)

Head to [Ak'Anon](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/55) and find [Clockwork VIIX](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/55017) in the North area of the zone. Give him [Jeb's Seal](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10604). He will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive [Enchanters Sack](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17861).

Combine [Spoon](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10614), [The One Key](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10615), [Lost Scroll](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10616), [Charm and Sacrifice](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10617) in [Enchanters Sack](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17861) to create [Sack for Mizzle](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10636).

Give [Clockwork VIIX](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/55017) [Sack for Mizzle](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10636) to receive [2nd Piece of Staff](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10611).

![Clockwork-VIIX-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Clockwork-VIIX-Map.jpg)
![Clockwork-VIIX-Map-2.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Clockwork-VIIX-Map-2.jpg)
![Clockwork-VIIX.jpg](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Clockwork-VIIX.jpg)

## Third Piece of Staff

### Step 4A
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/firiona/Nadia_Starfeast)

Find [Nadia Starfeast](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/84116) in [Firiona Vie](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/84). Give her [Jeb's Seal](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10604). She will hand it back. Say the following to get four different gems:

* `diamond`
* `sapphire`
* `emerald`
* `ruby`

You'll receive [Dull Diamond](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10631), [Dull Sapphire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10632), [Dull Emerald](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10634), [Dull Ruby](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10633). You'll need to charm various mobs and turn them in to receive the "Enchanted" versions.

![kunarkgatesnadia.png](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/kunarkgatesnadia.png)
![Nadia-Starfeast.png](/assets/images/epics/enchanter/Nadia-Starfeast.png)

### Step 4B
[Script Page](https://www.pqdi.cc/script-entities/kaesora/spectral_librarian)

Head to [Kaesora](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/88) and find [spectral librarian](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/88000). Charm him and give him [Dull Diamond](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10631) to receive [Enchanted Diamond](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/10618).

Kill mobs on the ground floor of the library until he spawns. I have also personally seen mobs despawn on their own and [spectral librarian](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/88000) spawn in their place, so he seems to have more than one method of spawning. PH's can be [minion of Xalgoz](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/88120) and [tortured librarian](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/88001).
