# Beastlord Epic - [Claw of the Savage Spirit](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/XXXXX)

## Pre-Farmable Items

- [ ] [Gem of the Void](#gem-of-the-void): Loot **2x** from [reaper](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/XXXXX) or [Xi Xaui](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/XXXXX) in [Maiden’s Eye](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/168)

- [ ] [Perfect Acrylia Ore](#perfect-acrylia-ore): Loot from [trap golems](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/XXXXX) in [The Grey](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/171)

## Step 1

Step 1 is the most tricky part of the entire epic. Go to Grimling Forest. Head to the town area in the Southeast (Light Blue Circle on Map).Grimling Forest has a “War” going on where approx. 10 battles take place across the zone. You can do each of these battles individually, and some of them drop Copper Medal of War, which you’ll need for the Beastlord 1.0. These battles seem to be half broken so don’t expect to get a Copper Medal of War right away. You may have to repeat these quests several times.

First, speak to Captain Necin, he should offer to take you to a camp. Follow his dialogue and say “ready to go“. He will then walk off to one of the 10 camps. Follow him. Upon arrival say “ready to fight” then kill all of the mobs at the camp. You may get a named to spawn (Bloodguard Kavgisin my case). If you do, kill it and you may get Copper Medal of War. If you don’t, don’t be surprised. Repeat this process until you get one.

You can also speak to other NPC’s in the town and they will take you to various battles as well. I have personally only used **Captain Necin**. It also has been said that it can drop from the trash (not confirmed).
