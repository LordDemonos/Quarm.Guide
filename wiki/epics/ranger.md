## The Quest

### Step 1
[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Telin_Darkforest)

Go to [Burning Woods](/zone/87) and locate [Telin Darkforest](/npc/87082) (+3240, +2880). Say "action" to receive [Worn Note](/item/20472).

You may need to do the [Muffin for Pandos](/script-entities/freportw/Pandos_Flintside) quest in [West Freeport](/zone/9) to get faction if he doesn't speak to you. You need at least high amiable (possibly higher).

![Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg)
![Telin-Darkforest.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest.jpg)

### Step 2
[Script Page](/script-entities/gfaydark/Faelin_Bloodbriar)

Go to [Greater Faydark](/zone/54)  to Loc: +1535, +570. At this spot [Faelin Bloodbriar](/npc/54237) spawns. Her PH is orc pawn. Respawn is 2.5 minutes. Clear orc pawns in the area until you find the right PH. Once found, kill the PH until [Faelin Bloodbriar](/npc/54237) spawns. Give her [Worn Note](/item/20472) to receive [Faelin's Ring](/item/20446).

**You can also forage a [Ripened Heartfruit](/item/20464) while here (See Step 7).**

![Faelin-Bloodbriar.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Faelin-Bloodbriar.jpg)
![orc-pawn.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/orc-pawn.jpg)

### Step 3
[Script Page](/script-entities/kithicor/Giz_X-Tin)

Go to [Kithikor Forest](/zone/20) and find [Giz X'Tin](/npc/20058). He roams so you'll need to track him. Give him [Faelin's Ring](/item/20446) to receive [Dark Metal Coin](/item/20447). Upon turnin [Teir'Dal Reaver](/npc/20190) will spawn and attack. You do not have to kill it for anything.

![Giz-Xtin.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Giz-Xtin.jpg)
![aTeirDal-Reaver.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/TeirDal-Reaver.jpg)

### Step 4
[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Telin_Darkforest)

Go back to [Telin Darkforest](/npc/87082) (+3240, +2880) in [Burning Woods](/zone/87). Give him [Dark Metal Coin](/item/20447) to receive [Worn Dark Metal Coin](/item/20448).

![Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg)
![Telin-Darkforest.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest.jpg)

### Step 5
[Script Page](/script-entities/eastkarana/Althele)

1. Head to [East Karana](/zone/15) and find [Althele](/npc/15044) (-3660, -1590). Give her [Worn Dark Metal Coin](/item/20448) to receive [Braided Grass Amulet](/item/20450). This will also spawn [Sionae](/npc/15178) nearby (-2590, -1600).

![Althele-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Althele-Map.jpg)
![Althele.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Althele.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/eastkarana/Sionae)

2. Give [Sionae](/npc/15178) (-2590, -1600) [Braided Grass Amulet](/item/20450) to receive [Frayed Braided Grass Amulet](/item/20451). This will also spawn [Nuien](/npc/15167) (-3650, +300).

![Sionae-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Sionae-Map.jpg)
![Sionae.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Sionae.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/eastkarana/Nuien)

3. Give [Nuien](/npc/15167) (-3650, +300) [Frayed Braided Grass Amulet](/item/20451), he will return it. This will also spawn [Teloa](/npc/15170) (-3850, -2850).

![Nuien-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Nuien-Map.jpg)
![Nuien.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Nuien.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/eastkarana/Teloa)

4. Give [Teloa](/npc/15170) (-3850, -2850) [Frayed Braided Grass Amulet](/item/20451). Follow her back to the "gathering spot". At this point [Dark Elf Corruptor](/npc/15153) and two [Dark Elf Reavers](/npc/15000) will spawn. Kill them and loot [Fleshbound Tome](/item/20452) from [Dark Elf Corrupter](/npc/15153).

![Teola-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Teola-Map.jpg)
![Teola.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Teola.jpg)

![Dark-Elf-Reaver.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Dark-Elf-Reaver.jpg)
![Dark-Elf-Corruptor.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Dark-Elf-Corruptor.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/eastkarana/Althele)

5. Give [Fleshbound Tome](/item/20452) to [Althele](/npc/15044) to receive [Earth Stained Note](/item/18959).

![Althele-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Althele-Map.jpg)
![Althele.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Althele.jpg)

### Step 6
[Script Page](/script-entities/misty/Ella_Foodcrafter)

Go to [Misty Thicket](/zone/33) and track down [Ella Foodcrafter](/npc/33077). Give her [Earth Stained Note](/item/18959) to receive [Shiny Tin Bowl](/item/17860).

**You can also forage a [Sweetened Mudroot](/item/20465) while here (See Step 7)**

![Ella-Foodcrafter.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Ella-Foodcrafter.jpg)

### Step 7

Go to the following zones and forage the following items:

* [Everfrost](/zone/30) - [Chilled Tundra Root](/item/20467)
* [Greater Faydark](/zone/54) - [Ripened Heartfruit](/item/20464)
* [Innothule Swamp](/zone/46) - [Speckled Molded Mushroom](/item/20466)
* [Misty Thicket](/zone/33) - [Sweetened Mudroot](/item/20465)

Once all 4 items have been obtained, combine them [Shiny Tin Bowl](/item/17860) to create [Hardened Mixture](/item/20473). Keep the bowl as well.

### Step 8
[Script Page](/script-entities/felwitheb/Niola_Impholder)

Next you need [Keepers of the Art](/faction/275) Faction. Buy 3,000 [Bat Wing](/item/13068) from any merchant (Ex: [Darius Gandril](/npc/202138), West Trade Building, Plane of Knowledge.) Give them to [Niola Impholder](/npc/62021) in [South Felwithe](/zone/62). You can reach her via the middle teleport pad. You can turn them all at once stacked together. This should be enough to get you to Ally with [Keepers of the Art](/faction/275). Ally isn't necessary (only need Amiable), but I'd just go all out since it is so easy to obtain. You'll also get a bunch of copies of level 1 Mage [Spell: Flare](/item/15310) upon turn-in so have some bag space. Just sell them.

**You must be at least Indifferent faction to do this batwing turn-in quest.** If you are not yet indifferent, you are likely close. You can check with /faction. Kill a few of the following NPC's in the link to get to Indifferent, at that point you'll be able to turn in the Batwings to get up to Amiable+. I just killed the ones in [Neriak Foreign Quarter](/zone/40).

![Niola-Impholder.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Niola-Impholder.jpg)

### Step 9
[Script Page](/script-entities/timorous/Alrik_Farsight)

Go to [Timorous Deep](/zone/96) and locate [Alrik Farsight](/npc/96032). He roams near the Chessboard. Take the dock from [Butcherblock](/zone/68) to get there the quickest. Say "i will take the artifact" to receive [Crushed Pot](/item/20457). You need at least Amiable faction with [Keepers of the Art]([Keepers of the Art](/faction/275)) for him to respond.

![Alrik-Farsight-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Alrik-Farsight-Map.jpg)
![Alrik-Farsight.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Alrik-Farsight.jpg)

![Merchant-Nora-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Merchant-Nora-Map.jpg)
![Merchant-Nora.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Merchant-Nora.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/felwitheb/Farios_Elianos)

* Go back to [South Felwithe](/zone/62) and give [Farios Elianos](/npc/62018) [Bag of Provisions](/item/20459) to receive [Receipt](/item/20474).

![Farios-Elianos-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Farios-Elianos-Map.jpg)

### Step 11

1. Go to [Firiona Vie](/zone/84) and forage [Rose of Firiona](/item/12774).
[Script Page](/script-entities/qrg/Merdan_Fleetfoot)

2. Go to [Surefall Glade](/zone/3) and find [Merdan Fleetfoot](/npc/3017). Say "Who is Niera" then give him [Rose of Firiona](/item/12774) to receive [Wood Painting](/item/20475).

![Merdan-Fleetfoot-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Merdan-Fleetfoot-Map.jpg)
![Merdan-Fleetfoot.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Merdan-Fleetfoot.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/frontiermtns/a_human_skeleton)

3. Go to [Frontier Mountains](/zone/92). Along the outside south wall of the Giant Fort you will find [a human skeleton](/npc/92084) (-820, -900). Give it [Wood Painting](/item/20475) to receive [Silver Chained Locket](/item/20476).

![a-human-skeleton-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/a-human-skeleton-Map.jpg)
![a-human-skeleton.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/a-human-skeleton.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/qrg/Niera_Farbreeze)

![Niera-Farbreeze-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Niera-Farbreeze-Map.jpg)
![Niera-Farbreeze.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Niera-Farbreeze.jpg)

### Step 12

Go to [City of Mist](/zone/90) and kill [a black reaver](/npc/90005) until you get [Jade Reaver](/item/5664). They spawn in different parts of the zone behind the locked door. Rare Drop. It is recommended to bring a pick lock class with you. It is also tradable so check the Bazaar.

![a-black-reaver.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/a-black-reaver.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/kaladimb/Kinlo_Strongarm)

Go to [North Kaladim](/zone/67) and give [Jade Reaver](/item/5664) to [Kinlo Strongarm](/npc/67030) to receive [Enchanted Clay](/item/20455).

![Kinlo-Strongarm-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Kinlo-Strongarm-Map.jpg)
![Kinlo-Strongarm.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Kinlo-Strongarm.jpg)

### Step 13

1. Combine the [Ancient Pattern](/item/18960) (from Step 10), [Platinum Speckled Powder](/item/20456) (From Step 11), and [Enchanted Clay](/item/20455) (From Step 12) in a Pottery Wheel to create [Runecrested Bowl](/item/20460). This is a no-fail combine.

[Script Page](/script-entities/misty/Ella_Foodcrafter)

2. Go to [Misty Thicket](/zone/33) and track down [Ella Foodcrafter](/npc/33077). Give her [Hardened Mixture](/item/20473) (From Step 7) and [Runecrested Bowl](/item/20460) (From Step 13) to receive [Softly Glowing Stone](/item/20462).

### Step 14

Read this entire Step before beginning.

Bring two items to [Karnor's Castle](/zone/102):

[Summoned: Firefly Globe](/item/10295): Summoned by [Spell: Dance of the Fireflies](/item/15237) (DRU (1) / RNG (10) Spell). It can only be summoned at night. This is a TEMP item.

[Spell: Resurrection](/item/15392): Level 47 Cleric spell - bring the "scroll" of the spell itself. You can buy it from many Cleric Spell vendors.

[Script Page](/script-entities/karnor/Venril_Sathirs_remains)

Kill [Venril Sathir](/npc/102099) in [Karnor's Castle](/zone/102). The version of [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010) you're looking for is the "triggered version". This triggered version is spawned from [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010)'s remains who spawns approx 12 hours (maybe 20? - see note below or 2/17/21 patch notes) after the death of the regular [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010).

[Script Page](/script-entities/karnor/Spirit_of_Venril_Sathir)

Once you find [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010)'s remains, give it [Summoned: Firefly Globe](/item/10295) (Ranger and Druid spell, can only be summoned at night). This will spawn [Spirit of Venril Sathir](/npc/102019). Give Spirit of [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010) the level 47 Cleric [Spell: Resurrection](/item/15392) to spawn [Venril Sathir](/npc/102021). Kill [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010) and loot [Pulsing Green Stone](/item/20461). He will drop two but you only need one. They are lore so bring someone along with you who might need one also.

![Venril-Sathir.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Venril-Sathir.jpg)
![Spirit-of-Venril-Sathir.png](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Spirit-of-Venril-Sathir.png)
![Venril-Sathirs-remains.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Venril-Sathirs-remains.jpg)

### Step 15
[Script Page](/script-entities/firiona/Foloal_Stormforest)

1. Go to [Firiona Vie](/zone/84) and locate [Foloal Stormforest](/npc/84207). She will be either in the ruins or the city depending on what expansion your server is on. It's easiest to just track her. Give her [Pulsing Green Stone](/item/20461) (From Step 14) and [Softly Glowing Stone](/item/20462) (From Step 13) to receive [Warmly Glowing Stone](/item/20468).

![Foloal-Stormforest-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Foloal-Stormforest-Map.jpg)
![Foloal-Stormforest.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Foloal-Stormforest.jpg)

[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Telin_Darkforest)

2. Go back to [Burning Woods](/zone/87) and find [Telin Darkforest](/npc/87082). Give him [Warmly Glowing Stone](/item/20468) to receive [Ancient Longsword](/item/20477).

![Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg)
![Telin-Darkforest.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest.jpg)

### Step 16
[Script Page](/script-entities/hole/Jaeil_the_Wretched)

Head over to [The Hole](/zone/39) and find [Jaeil the Wretched](/npc/39041) in the tunnels. Give him [Shiny Tin Bowl](/item/17860) (Step 7) to spawn [Jaeil the Insane](/npc/39154). Kill [Jaeil the Insane](/npc/39154) and loot [Soulbound Hammer](/item/20478). He is pretty easy and should be 1 groupable.

![Jaeil-the-Wretched-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Jaeil-the-Wretched-Map.jpg)
![Jaeil-the-Insane.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Jaeil-the-Insane.jpg)
![Jaeil-the-Wretched.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Jaeil-the-Wretched.jpg)

### Step 17

Go to [Plane of Sky](/zone/71) and kill [an essence tamer](/npc/71071) on Island 4 (griffon island). You can spawn them by killing [an essence carrier](npc/71070). an essence carrier spawns by killing a soul carrier. Loot [Swirling Sphere of Color](/item/20494). Seems to always drop from [an essence tamer](/npc/71071).

![an-essence-tamer.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/an-essence-tamer.jpg)

### Step 18
[Script Page](/script-entities/erudnint/Mairee_Silentone)

Go to [Erudin Palace](/zone/23) and find [Mairee Silentone](/npc/23019) in the Jewelcrafting area. She is behind the vault door in "Sothure's FINE GEMS".

First, Give her [Soulbound Hammer](/item/20478) by itself to receive [Dwarven Smiths Hammer](/item/20479).

Next, give her [Dwarven Smiths Hammer](/item/20479) along with [Swirling Sphere of Color](/item/20494) to receive [Hammer of the Ancients](/item/20485).

![Mairee-Silentone-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Mairee-Silentone-Map.jpg)
![Mairee-Silentone.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Mairee-Silentone.jpg)

### Step 19
[Script Page](/script-entities/kaladimb/Kinlo_Strongarm)

Go to [North Kaladim](/zone/67) and locate [Kinlo Strongarm](/npc/67030). Give him [Hammer of the Ancients](/item/20485) to receive [Small Bit of Mithril Ore](/item/20482). This will also spawn [Usbak the Old](/npc/67089).

Give [Usbak the Old](/npc/67089) [Ancient Longsword](/item/20477) (From Step 15) to receive [Refined Ancient Sword](/item/20481).

Give [Kinlo Strongarm](/npc/67030) [Small Bit of Mithril Ore](/item/20482) to receive [Refined Mithril Blade](/item/20483).

![Kinlo-Strongarm-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Kinlo-Strongarm-Map.jpg)
![Usbak-the-Old.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Usbak-the-Old.jpg)
![Kinlo-Strongarm.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Kinlo-Strongarm.jpg)

### Step 20 - [Swiftwind](/item/20487)
[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Telin_Darkforest)
[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Faelin_Bloodbriar)

Go back to [Burning Woods](/zone/87). Give [Telin Darkforest](/npc/87082) [Refined Ancient Sword](/item/20481). He will give it back and [Faelin](/npc/87019) will spawn. Now give [Refined Ancient Sword](/item/20481) to [Faelin](/npc/87019) to receive [Swiftwind](/item/20487)!

![Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg](/assets/images/epics/ranger/Telin-Darkforest-Map.jpg)

### Step 21

Go to [Plane of Hate](/zone/76) and loot [Shattered Emerald of Corruption](/item/20484). I got mine from [Master of Spite](/npc/76331), but it can drop off of most named in the zone. Uncommon Drop.

### Step 22 - [Earthcaller](/item/20488)
[Script Page](/script-entities/northkarana/Xanuusus)
