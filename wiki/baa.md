# AA's that will remain broken/useless or act differently than you expect

Here you will find a list that may save you some headaches. There are a number of AA's that may not do what you expect them to do because of your class or your experiences later in EQ's life. Remember bugged/useless AA's that existed on AK will likely remain that way on TAKP since AK gameplay is trying to emulated here.

| AA's to be Cautious of |
| --- |
| Name | Classes affected | How you may expect it to work | How it actually works |
| Celestial Regeneration | Cleric | Group heal over time spell. | Single target ability instead. Also the refresh timer is incorrect. It will display 15 minutes, but won't be able to use for the full 72 minutes. |
| Channeling Focus | Bards only | Allows you to channel through what would otherwise be an interrupt | It does nothing at all since Bards don't channel here. Just don't buy this AA if a Bard. |
| Extended Notes | Bard | Affects the range of all AE type spells | Only affects beneficial group songs, does not affect those songs that are AE based (resists, Lceas, etc) or PBAoE songs (dots, snares, etc) |
| Frenzied Burnout | Magician | Stack will all haste up to the NPC limit | Currently doesn't stack with "Ancient: Burnout Blaze" due to slot2: armor class buff stacking issue, it over-rides 80% haste of Ancient Burnout with 15% haste v3 of the AA which makes your pet do a lot less dmg. Upgraded spell (Burnout V)in PoP may resolve. |
| Jam Fest | Bard | The effects from the higher singing level increases a song's power on your group members (higher stats, etc) | Only the Bard benefits from the higher singing level. Bard will receive the higher stats from the song, but not anyone else in the group. |
| Hobble Spirits | Beastlord | Stop a fleeing mob. | The snare component maxes at 40% and while that is enough to stop a lot of mobs at the lower levels (and some at the upper), it is largely dependent on the mob's flee speed. It will often not stop a fleeing mob at the higher levels when you need it to. It also will block certain pet proc spells, such as Spirit of Snow. |
| Poison Mastery | Rogue | Description says: "Once one point is trained in this ability, you will never fail at poison application again." | You can still fail at applying poisons, however the other functions of the AA still work. |
| Spell Casting Deftness and Quick Buff | Enchanter | AA's should stack. | These AA's are redundant. Server side limit on spell casting haste is 50%, so you can get QB3 and it makes SCD pointless. This includes focus items and spells (BoF) as well. So, if you already have a focus item that gives you 25%, then you would only need QB2 to achieve that 50% as an example. Anything more would waste purchased AA's. |
| Fleet of Foot | Bard | Darchon said: "I believe this was broken on AK and would actually slow down bards. But I did a quick test on dev server. With no AA my #showstats runspeed was shown as 1.8 with Selos on. With ranks 1 and 2 of the AA it is still 1.8." | Solar (TAKP Dev) resolved as: "I came up with a workaround for this. The AA people spent will be refunded and everyone will get FoF 3 for free (it normally only goes to level 2). This makes it so groups of mac/windows players will all be the same speed for /follow and bards can no longer buy this ability." https:// www.takproject.net/forums/index.php?threads/fleet-of-foot-slows-down- bards-instead-of-speeding-them-up.21415/#post-105913 |
