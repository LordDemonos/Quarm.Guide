## Part 4: Installing Optional 3rd Party Programs

These programs add functionality not found in the game client by reading your EverQuest player log files. Programs that use hooks to inject code into the game are now allowed, with the one exception being Zeal.

#### GINA

A log monitoring application that provides audio and visual feedback based on triggers you either define or import.

- [Official Website](https://eq.gimasoft.com/gina/Default.aspx) | [Supplemental Documentation](https://kingdomdkp.com/index.php/Guides/Tools/How-to-installing-gina--basic-functions.html?)

#### EQ Nag

An EverQuest notification agent. An alternative to GINA.

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases) | [Documentation](https://guildantix.github.io/eq-nag/)

#### NParse (TAKP Fork)

Provides player location and spell tracking support for TAKP by reading the player log.

#### Quarm Tool

Log parser containing 3D Maps, Timers for everything, damage meters, and mob info.

#### ZlizEQMap

ZlizEQMap is a map tool mainly designed for servers that emulate old versions of EverQuest. It features a local database of maps from the old EQAtlas website (now hosted on allakabor.com and tessmage.com), along with player positioning (x plotted on map), transparent overlay, waypoints, zone connections, and more.

This resource is Luclin + PoP maps & data to be used with the ZlizEQMap program.

#### Keilly's Supplemental Maps for ZlizEQMap

These are new maps made to work with ZlizEQMap and you'll find your location and coordinates will be more accurate using these over the EQAtlas maps. Maps are for the most part larger than the ones from EQAtlas used in ZlizEQMap, and are best suited for use on a second monitor.

#### EQ Tell Notifier

Desktop notifications for tells received in game.

- [GitHub Link](https://github.com/rtcox/EQ_tell_notifier/tree/main)

#### Lossless Scaling

Lossless Scaling allows you to scale windowed games to full screen using the state-of-the-art scaling algorithms, as well as use ML based proprietary scaling and frame generation.

- [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/)

#### Borderless Gaming

I don't use this with EQ but I need to mention it alongside Lossless Scaling. I use it with my 4k OLED monitor to remove the Windows border around games sometimes to prevent OLED burn-in. It's pricey on Steam but free on Github.

## Part 5: Third Party Websites

I was hesitant to make a list as they seem to pop up and go stagnant pretty quickly. There's a couple Quarm specific sites you need to know about though.

### Project Quarm Database Interface 

- [pqdi.cc](https://www.pqdi.cc/) This site pulls data directly from the Project Quarm database, so everything is super accurate. Invaluable on your adventure.

### EQTunnelAuctions

- [eqtunnelauctions](https://www.eqtunnelauctions.com/) Allows you to look up items recently sold in the EC tunnel and compare price trends.

### TAKP Wiki

- [TAKP Wiki](https://wiki.takp.info/index.php/Main_Page) p99 Wiki is great for user content, but its not accurate to Quarm in many cases. TAKP Wiki doesn't have as much user content, but it's more accurate so keep that in mind.

### AllaQUARM

- [AllaQUARM](https://eqtunnelauctions.com/alla/) Quarm's version of Allakhazam, also pulls from the database like PQDI.
