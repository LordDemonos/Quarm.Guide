## A Brief Introduction to Project Quarm ![Quarm](/img/Quarm.png)

Welcome to [Project Quarm](https://projectquarm.com/), a 1-Box EverQuest emulated server based on the [TAKProject](https://www.takproject.net/) codebase! We are currently in the [Classic 1.6](#classic-1x-october-1st-2023) era with Kunark Pre-release coming June 1st.

Some server highlights include: TLP through Planes of Power at 9 month intervals, instanced raid encounters, legacy items drop forever, hardcore and solo self found gameplay modes, custom content and events, and a ton of QOL features through [Zeal](https://github.com/iamclint/Zeal).
