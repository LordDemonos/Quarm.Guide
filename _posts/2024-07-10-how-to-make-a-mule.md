## Mule Accounts

Mule accounts are available in game. Mule accounts are exempt from IP restrictions, allowing you to run a game client and buy/sell/transfer items independent of your main account.  Here are the steps to create a mule account, along with some warnings:

1.	Create a new game account using the same TAKP forum account you use on your main character. Nothing else needs to be done on TAKP website, their trader settings are different from Project Quarm's.

2.	Log out of your main account, and log in to the mule game account.  IP exemption won't work until the account is officially flagged as a mule account.

3.	Create a new character on this account and achieve level 2.

4.	Once you level, type #makemule and press enter.  Some prompts will follow to make sure you really want to do this.  ALL characters on the entire account will be flagged as mules, ported to East Commonlands, trapped there, and be level 1 eternally.  Make sure to ONLY do this on the mule account.

5.	You'll be logged out, de-leveled to 1, and teleported to East Commonlands.

6.	You're done!  The IP exemption should be in place, so you can log back in and play your main while making deals in the tunnel.
