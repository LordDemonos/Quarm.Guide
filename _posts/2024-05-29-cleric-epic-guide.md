## Cleric Epic Guide

### Foreword
This guide was created using [Kingdom Cleric Epic's Guide](https://kingdomdkp.com/index.php/Guides/Kingdom-cleric-epic.html?) which is based on [wiki.project1999.com/Cleric_epic](https://wiki.project1999.com/Cleric_epic). This guide was made for personal use only. Project Quarm Epic Quest guides can be found on [pqdi.cc](https://pqdi.cc). 

## Orb of Frozen Water

1. Loot [Lord Bergurgle's Crown](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28044) from [Lord Bergurgle](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/51143) in [Lake Rathetear](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/51).    

Step 1 is possible to be skipped. The Lord Bergurgle's Crown is only for spawn of Natasha in Rathe Lake. If somebody else doing this step and is spawning Natasha, you can turn in your quest item to Natasha at the same time. Natasha will remain for about 5 minutes with or without turning anything.

Lord Bergurgle can be found at the X underwater. He's located on the top floor of the tower. The placeholder is on 29 minute respawn timer. He can also get healed by the goblins around him. It's recommended to bring a high level pet class to solo this. The other 2 guards are on a 6 minute 40 second respawn timer.

2. Give Crown to [Shmendrik Lavawalker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/51012) in [Lake Rathetear](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/51) to spawn [Natasha Whitewater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96080) nearby - receive [Oil of Fennin Ro](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28045).

See the comments of Step 1.  Warning: Natasha will immediately attack Shmendrik or Spirit of Flame when she spawns and if she makes the last hit to Spirit of Flame, the corpse will disappear. At this step, you need to Root/CC Natasha first. After you have looted the Damaged crown, memory blur Natasha and then turn in.

3. Kill [Shmendrik Lavawalker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/51012) to spawn [A Spirit of Flame](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/51145).

Shmendrik is on 3 hours respawn. This is an easier camp than Lord Bergurgle which can easily take you more time. No matter whether you turn in your Lord Bergurgle's Crown to him or not, after you slay him, the Spirit of Flame will spawn. Shmendrik spawns at the X below:

4. Loot [Damaged Goblin Crown](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28046) from [A Spirit of Flame](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/51145) (Do not let [Natasha Whitewater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96080) get the last hit or the corpse will disappear).
5. Give [Damaged Goblin Crown](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28046) to [Natasha Whitewater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96080) - receive [Ornate Sea Shell](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28047).

As described in Step 1, multiple people can turn in their Damaged crown at same time. If you have Lord Burgurgle's crown and are going to Spawn Natasha, maybe you could @Clerics in discord, so you can possibly save some other person's time.

6. Give [Ornate Sea Shell](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28047) to [Omat Vastsea](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96033) in [Timorous Deep](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/96) -- receive [Coral Statue of Tarew](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28051).

7. Give the [Coral Statue of Tarew](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28051) to a [Seeker](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/80028) in [The Temple of Solusek Ro](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/80) causing them to become [A Plasmatic Priest](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/80042).

There are several seekers present in the Temple of Ro, but only one is the correct one for the cleric epic quest. The correct seeker for the cleric 1.0 is a human male seeker located in a small throne room on the second floor; the throne room is next to #15 noted on the 2nd floor map of the Temple of Ro. The 1.0 seeker spawns to the left of the dais at 9 A.M. game time, replacing a keeper, and despawns at 8 P.M game time, being replaced by a keeper again. When the Coral Statue of Tarew Marr is turned in to this seeker he will attack. Fight him in the hallway to avoid unwanted adds. Once killed he will respawn again within several minutes if it's still daytime.

8. Kill [A Plasmatic Priest](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/80042) in [The Temple of Solusek Ro](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/80)  and loot [Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1299).

A target for the Cleric Epic Quest spawned by giving a specific a seeker (330, 40, 30) a Coral Statue of Tarew. He is KOS to everybody and will immediately attack. Casts Complete Heal, Reckoning, Annul Magic, and Word Divine which is a PBAE that can affect mobs around the priest causing them to attack him which could result in the quest being failed, and so he is often fought away from mobs usually at the zoneline. He does not have particularly impressive resists, but he does summon. This fight is easy with a small group of 60s. Will despawn if not engaged within 10 minutes.

Note: Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe is tradeable, so you can bring your alt (pet class) to do the steps above and transfer the robe to your cleric after this step.

9. Give the [Robe](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/1299) to [Omat Vastsea](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96033) –- receive [Orb of Frozen Water](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28048) (This spawns Natasha inside the hut, It is suggested you wait to turn in until you have [Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28018)).

You can find Omat and Natasha here. Ohmat is outside the hut, Natasha is inside. There are 2 underwater tunnels in the way, bring your Enduring Breath and Levitation equipment.

## Orb of Clear Water

1. Loot [Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28018) from [Lord Gimblox](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/31126) in [Solusek's Eye](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/31).

You can find Lord Gimblox here:
![Lord Gimblox](/assets/images/epics/cleric/lord_gimblox.webp)

2. Give [Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28018) to [Natasha Whitewater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96080) in [Timorous Deep](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/96) - receive [Ornate Sea Shell](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28047)(no 2).

To Spawn this Natasha in Timorous Deep, you need turn in your Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe to Ohmat usually, but it's not mandatory. It's possible to do the turn in to a Natasha spawned by someone else(what ever the steps others are on, just need to be in the Timorous Deep). But keep this in mind, the turn in of Signet Ring at this step WILL DESPAWN Natasha. So if you are piggy backing on other clerics, please hold your ring tightly and double check if the other cleric has done their turn ins already. Only do this last because this will make Natasha despawn. 

3. Give [Ornate Sea Shell](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28047)(no 2) to [Naxot Deepwater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/87002) in [Burning Woods](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/87) - receive [Message to Natasha](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28052) (This spawns Ixiblat Fer).

Naxot can be found at X below and the wiki says it will despawn when you turn in the Sea Shell. However this is not true. (We) did kill a row of Ixiblat of 2 or 3 last time. The trick is to root or cc Naxot when Ixiblat spawns to prevent him from attacking Ixiblat. Then Naxot wont die to it. We can then do another turn in after one Ixiblat dies.

4. Loot [Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28017) from [Ixiblat Fer](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/87014) in [Burning Woods](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/87).

Ixiblat can be found at X below. He hits very hard (quad 600ish) and has some fire AOE, but can be snared and slowed.  You will need help from your guild and coordinate with raid leaders ahead of time. 3 groups with a few clerics are enough for this.

![Ixiblat Fer](/assets/images/epics/cleric/ixiblat_fer.webp)

5. Loot [Singed Scroll](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18170) from [Overking Bathezid](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/103056) in [Chardok](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/103).

6. Give [Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28017) and [Singed Scroll](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/18170) to [Omat Vastsea](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96033) - receive [Orb of Clear Water](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28048) (This spawns Natasha inside the hut).

## Orb of Vapor (Classic)

1. Give [Message to Natasha](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28052) (Received when spawning Ixiblat Fer) to [Natasha Whitewater](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96080) in [Timorous Deep](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/96) - receive [Shimmering Pearl](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/20863).*

Doing this turn in WILL NOT despawn Natasha. So you can piggy back on other cleric who's doing the Sceptre and Scroll turn in or the robe turn in. This Natasha will despawn after about 5 minutes (need confirmation and update).

2. Give Shimmering Pearl](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/20863)to [Zordak Ragefire](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/32038) in [Nagafen's Lair](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/32) -- causes him to respawn as [Zordakalicus Ragefire](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/91006) and attack you - kill and loot [Heart of Zordak Ragefire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17122). `Quarm Note: Doesn't drop the right heart? Impure?`

When Ragefire (Human male NPC in Naggy lair) spawns you as a cleric(or driver) need to do the following steps:
1) Turn in Shimmering Pearl to the NPC.
2) This will make him KoS. You can survive probably somehow (run away immediately after the turn in, root CC him etc), or maybe just die there and get rez later.
3) Kill the KoS human -> This spawns Ragefire.
4) Kill the dragon form Ragefire.

3. Give [Heart of Zordak Ragefire](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/17122) to [Omat Vastsea](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96033) – receive [Orb of Vapor](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28050) (Do NOT do this until ready to turn all orbs into Jhassad, as this step spawns Jhassad for the final turn in).

## Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh

1. Give Orbs (Clear Water / Frozen Water / Vapor) to [Jhassad Oceanson](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96074) in [Timorous Deep](https://www.pqdi.cc/zone/96) -- receive [Orb of Triumvirate](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28023) (This spawns the [Avatar of Water](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96086) in the lake).

2. Give [Orb of Triumvirate](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/28023) to [Avatar of Water](https://www.pqdi.cc/npc/96086) - receive [Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/6500).
