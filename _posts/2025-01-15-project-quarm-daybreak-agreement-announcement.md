## Exciting News: Project Quarm Daybreak Agreement

We have some exciting news to share with all of you.

As some of you may be aware, Project Quarm has been offline for a few weeks now. Taking down the server was performed as a show of good faith to Daybreak Game Company. Following this, we reached out to Daybreak Game Company to discuss our options for an agreement similar to the one Project 1999 had created and began to explore options.

As hardcore fans of their games, we have always strived to promote the official game of EverQuest that we all love. We would like to personally thank all the folks at Daybreak for this opportunity.

## The Agreement

As a result of our discussion, we have entered into a written agreement with Daybreak Game Company LLC. This agreement formally recognizes Project Quarm as a personal, non-commercial, not-for-profit fan-based private server and establishes the guidelines that we as a project must follow. This agreement will allow us to continue to update the game without risk of legal repercussions.

As a lifelong fan of over 23 years, it is an incredible privilege to have this consideration, and we are honored to share in our love of EverQuest with our community.

## Server Changes

Project Quarm will be fast-forwarding the server to Luclin when it returns. Please stay tuned for more information about the server's return within the coming weeks.

### What's Changing

**Luclin Launch:**
- Luclin launches when the server comes back up
- All Luclin features including AAs, Beastlords, Focus effects and the like will be available immediately
- Luclin raids will not be available until the original Luclin launch date (Jan 1st, 2026)
- Luclin raid mobs will not spawn in open world as is consistent with how all other instanced raids are handled

**Bazaar System:**
- Bazaar will support offline traders
- Support for playing a character while a trader is offline on the same account will be added at a later date
- The mule system will be retired accordingly
- Mule accounts will be converted to normal accounts and must be dealt with accordingly

**Server Infrastructure:**
- The server will have a population cap of 1200 players with a queue system

## Content Removals

Project Quarm contains a number of changes to the base game that make various modifications to the base game of EverQuest through the EverQuest: Planes of Power expansion. Some of those modifications, however, were determined to be a step too far for a personal, non-commercial fan-based private server.

As such, we were asked to remove specific items as part of our agreement. These are the following items:

### Custom Zones:
- Myriah's Domain
- Shard of Decay
- Plane of Injustice
- Fireclad Ocean

### Custom Raid Encounters:
- Khati Sha

### Custom Player Race and Class Unlocks:
- Iksar Rogue (quest) and their related items / NPCs
- Iksar Ranger (quest) and their related items / NPCs
- Wood Elf Beastlord (quest) and their related items / NPCs
- Barbarian Paladin (quest) and their related items / NPCs
- Froglok Race (and their associated graphical updates and illusion items)

### Features:
- Item tinting/armor fixes

### Custom Expansion: Terror of Sul
- Gone Completely

### Incomplete Quests:
- Kunark Archaeologist
- Completing incomplete quests like unused purpose of Varsoon, Iksar Cudgel, etc.
- Addition of Iksar quests similar to that of Cudgel, Shackle for Iksar Rogue, Ranger

We may remove extra additions on request by Daybreak Game Company at any time.

## Looking Forward

The details of the Queue system will be announced at a later date as some aspects are still in development. We're excited to bring Project Quarm back to the community with these new features and improvements while maintaining the core experience that players have come to love.
