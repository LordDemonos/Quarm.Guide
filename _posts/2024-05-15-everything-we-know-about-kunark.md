## Pre-Kunark Launch

Classic 1.9: June 1st, 2024 (1 month)

- Special event: 1 month Kunark-Locked Iksar early access (Level Cap 50, some zones restricted)

We will be performing downtime on June 1st, 2024 at 12pm ET. We will keep the server down for three hours and unlock at 3pm ET. We may run into issues with the deployment of the patch, though we are targeting a 3pm ET unlock time.

Upon completion of the maintenance, Patch 1.9 will be deployed to the server and Iksars will be available for creation. They will be able to play in Kunark zones and cannot leave Kunark. Non-Iksars cannot enter Kunark zones. Please note that mules are unavailable for Iksar characters until July 1st, 2024 at 3pm ET, when Kunark officially launches.

### Pre-Kunark Epic Content

Just so there's no surprises on launch day, **we will be enabling Patch 2.0 content (including epic drops) when we release Patch 1.9.** This means that you can gather epic pieces on Kunark with your level 50 Iksars, or with the characters not within Kunark.

- Wraith of a Shissir will drop in Patch 2.0

``Content does NOT include features like:

- Level 60
- Access to Kunark zones for non Iksars
- Access to Classic zones for Iksars``

The zones being restricted on Pre-Kunark launch are the following:

- Veeshan's Peak
- Kunark Instances

Those will be available on the 1st of July.

All Kunark raid creatures will have natural spawn times during the Iksar Early Access period.

For the sake of intra-continent travel, the following zones are considered Kunark zones:

- Timorous Deep
- Firiona Vie
- The Overthere

If an Iksar attempts to zone into a non-Kunark zone, they will be teleported to Cabilis instead. If a non-Iksar attempts to zone into a Kunark zone, they will be teleported to East Commonlands instead.

## Kunark Era Resists
From Torven of TAKP:

"This change alters the resist spell method to try and mimic the classic, pre-September 2002 resists while keeping the 0-200 scale and -resist adjusts on spells. Switching to the 0-99 scale would be too disruptive and troublesome to implement and would require a lot of database changes, so maintaining much of the PoP era system was desirable. These changes are all gated to late Luclin and earlier.

Changes in this commit:

    Lifetaps on client targets are unresistable.
    Resist hardcap of 250 in Classic and Kunark eras, 350 after Kunark.
    Softcap at 200, overcap returns are half.
    Dragon breaths with a lure component hardcoded to be -100 instead of -150.
    Immolating Breath and Stun Breath hardcoded to be granted resist modifiers.
    Enchanter NPCs will be able to land spells on high resist targets.
    Partial hit damage is reduced for 51+ client casters. (it's kept as it is at level 50 and under)
    Partial damage taken by clients is increased.

I omitted the resist floors due to how disruptive those would be. In some scenarios the resists are knowingly more lenient (higher caps) in this than in the Kunark decompile because the hardcap back then was rather harsh and the effectiveness per point of resist is reduced in many cases due to the 200 scale, requiring more resist to reach the same mitigation as classic. I also believe that Sony likely altered the resist function at Velious launch to make resisting dragons easier and I can't say how exactly, but the obvious move would have been to raise the hardcap so that's what I did."

## Misc

- An elective service will be available during the Kunark pre-release period:
  `Promotion of Iksar Guild Leader character: 2000p`

- boost gorgalosk to 2 loots
