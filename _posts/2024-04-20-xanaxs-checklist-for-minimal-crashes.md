## Xanax's Checklist for Minimal Crashes

I started this because half of my guild seems to crash when they zone in and out of the planes. Everyone is on different pieces and versions of this game. Meanwhile I've thrown most of this configuration into 3 different game folders and they all work well, only crashing occasionally when I drop to character select, or if I change my audio output source. Here's what I'm using:

1. 2.2 version of TAKP.
2. .dll from 3/1 still has the smoothest camera. For some reason 5/6 makes me jiter again.
3. Excluded TAKP folder from antivirus scanning.
4. Always running the latest Zeal unless it contains a specific bug I want to avoid. Always keep previous versions backed up.
5. dgVoodoo fix
6. Directx 9c (Windows said I had a newer version of Visual C already installed, so I didnt download the one above.)
7. Running program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2).
8. Also running several muted sound files, EQ Basic 1.1, KaichoFX Spell Effects, and the game looks absolutely amazing!

If you ask me, 2 & 3 are the biggest contributors to stability. A lot of people seem to need the dgVoodoo fix though, especially if they have integrated graphics, so thats also important. Hopefully we can lessen these crashes and work towards fixing the rest over time.
